0,"We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.","Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",1

2,"But I didn't. 

I decided I had enough. I made a plan to jump off a parking garage, I wrote a note and I left. I walked there in the cold. Walked halfway up the ramp, got in the elevator to go up to the top but it wouldn't go. I pushed the top floor button but the elevator didn't move. So I pushed level 1. Got out and saw a bar. 

I'm 3 beers deep sitting alone writing this. I didn't jump. I didn't kill myself. I don't feel any better but I'm not dead.

You are experiencing a true low in your life to point where you consider to off yourself and you get generic upbeat music while waiting on a person that could that could be your lifeline. I wanted to cry, but I just laughed at the absurdity of it.

8,"On November 18th 2010 in Grasslake michigan my mother was reported missing by her boyfriend. I was 15 at the time. Days had passed and he ended up stealing a com-tronics van. No one truly knows why. He got arrested for that and committed suicide in jail. He was the last person to see her. After multiple searches over the years nothing was found. Still 10 years later. Nothing has been found. This trauma has completely shaped me since. Im so fucked up on so many levels its truly hard to even think of it all to begin to write it. I hold it all together well. Have a family and good job and stuff. But on the inside im losing it. I dream of my mom being back and everything back to normal to wake up to the reality and it tares me up. Ive never seen a therapist and im scared they will think im insane for some of my thoughts. Imagining your mothers death in every way possible for years has taken its toll.

11,"I’m 25 and I’ve hated my life so far. Hated it.

I think I’m getting closer to ending things, and I’m fine with that.

To quickly summarise why I’m so miserable - the main thing is that I can’t make friends or relationships. I’ve always been alone. Always. And it has made me angry over the years.

I’ve pooled so much time into my main hobby - piano - but what’s the point? No one has ever heard me play. I don’t eat until I get stabbing pains in my stomach. I don’t follow the news anymore because I just don’t care.

I’m trying to get a date using dating apps, but it feels like an impossible task. I get ignored no matter how I spin things. No matter how I start the conversation. No matter what my dating profile looks like. And I know how to make a good looking profile - it’s not just me scowling in a dark room.

I’m only 25 and yet I feel like a grumpy 80 year old who is done with life. If nothing will change, then I really don’t want to stick around. There’s no point. When I look to the future, I see no happiness. I only see me sitting in a room by myself, depressed and lonely.

Something else I want to point out is that in all these posts and all my rants, no one ever gives good advice. I’ve done CBT and they never gave me good advice either. It’s just a load of bullshit like ‘learn to love yourself’. How? HOW? ‘Get outside’ - staring at ducks, alone, doesn’t improve my mood. ‘Face your fears’ - how the hell do I face my fears - dating - if no one says yes when I ask them out? ‘Try meds/therapy’ - medication doesn’t cure anything, and in my case just offers shitty side effects, and therapists seem useless, at least the ones I’ve dealt with. ‘Join a sports society’ - I was attempting to do this but lucky me, COVID made an appearance and fucked everything up.

I can tell my colleagues are getting worried about me, but it’s only because I’m opening up more because I don’t care about retaining my job. Maybe if I’m thrown to the streets and homeless it’ll be easier to kill myself.

15,"I'm 13F and honestly just writing this post makes me feel like i'm some attention seeking karma whore by itself.

Though I felt like I should leave this here I guess. No one will probably read it though.

Recently I've been really depressed and kinda suicidal , of course there's millions of people going through worse things than me and I'm probably being very overdramatic but my best friend started bullying me around 7th grade, I still wanted to be his friend but he kept either avoiding me spreading rumours about me, or shitalking me to everyone else. 

I am not kidding when I say I literally only had one friend. But I barely hung around him either cause everyone would bombard me with simp wouldnt even let me speak to him without constant insults being thrown at me.

So just having a toxic best friend and getting low key bullied gave me depression. I know, petty as fuck.

I really don't wanna be depressed anymore, but I don't wanna put in the effort to stop being depressed. I just can't bring myself to try so hard to be in a mediocre state of life for the next 70 years it sounds like such a drag to live.

I didn't ask to exist. I don't want to exist. They say suicide isn't the answer but nothing else feels like the  answer. Improving myself and holding on does sound like the ""right answer"" but I just can't be bothered to put in the effort to keep on living.

I have a great life, but I just don't wanna exist anymore were all gonna die anyway and no one will remeber me in the long term either way I'm not reall important so why do I have to drag along life.

I know I don't have it in myself to commit to be honest. I'm too scared to do anything and can't find a good painless way to go, but I'd really like to die right about now.

17,"I've always been highly self conscious. A perfectionist. When I make a mistake, it absolutely destroys me. 

Then something comes along and there is no good solution. All you can do is wait for time to kill the pain. And there is no one who can resolve it. I alienate people. I see why people become alcoholics and drug addicts - I desperately need a way to cope. 

Am I playing a victim? Am I a guilt tripper? Am I even a good person? Have I been such a perfectionist, trying to be in the right, that it turns me into the antagonist? I think mentally I've reached a point of no return.

I don't know if I'm right or wrong.

I keep switching from bouts of extreme optimism to pessimism, and I can't fucking stand the wavering. Idk what I should even be thinking.

37,"1) Girlfriend left me overnight without warning. To simplify it, I more-or-less went out for a walk, came home, and bam, her shit's gone and that's it. She was also banging people from work, including the store manager, so I couldn't stay there after that and had to job hop a bit.

2) Earlier this year, in February, I had my nose broken when someone tried to mug me as I was coming home. I had surgery to repair the appearance, but the surgery was a failure in terms of repairing my ability to breathe out of my nose. This meant I couldn't kiss my girlfriend anymore, leading her to make out with guys behind me.

3) I had a cavity I noticed way back in June, but dentist offices wouldn't treat non-emergencies. I had called back then and explained the pain and condition I had, and they said no. Well, over this last weekend, the pain was so severe that I'd honestly, seriously say it was the worst pain I ever felt. More than breaking a bone, more than when I was a kid and my stupid friend threw a brick at my head and cracked my skull. The infection has reached the actual bone of my jaw, and if I don't pull the tooth soon, I'm going to probably get sepsis, which can be life-threatening. But aha! Because of my nose condition, I need a sedation dentist, and that kind of specialty has a longer waiting time and I need to wait for a referral.

4) So much life stress that I've gained a massive amount of weight. I used to be 130, I'm at least 180, maybe 200, I'm too embarrassed at myself to step on a scale to even know for sure. I'd rather not know. I'm so insecure about my weight.

I've never had a positive relationship with my identical twin sister. Some of my earliest memories are of us fighting, like the time she slammed my head against a coffee table and badly cut my ear, or the time she broke my finger with a backpack. My whole relationship with her is filled with arguments, fighting and whatnot,  shes never been there for me emotionally either. I was going through another depressive episode a while ago and she noticed that I was self-harming. Instead of helping me at all she told everyone and make a joke out of me.  I'm so fucking sick of people saying ""Oh are you two twins? that must be so nice!' I've been hearing it since i was barely walking upright. Every day I'm compared to her, my grades, my friends, it's all been mixed in with hers. I just want to be recognized as me and not ""\_\_\_'s twin"". Every embarrassing mistake she makes I pay for, if i ever get a new video game or something guess what? It's hers too.

Depression isn't the word, more like knowingly traumatized but waiting to see how it manifests itself exactly. My support system isn't that great. I'm secular and rely heavily on the philosophy I'm familiar with(namely German pessimism). There's a wealthy man offering to help me expand my business but I've been thinking about walking away from everything and everybody here and relocating to the West Coast, perhaps Oregon, and living a much simpler life. I mentioned this to someone I know and he said I'm just traumatized. My mother thinks something is off too. But it's just this feeling I have that some drastic change needs to occur, otherwise I'll lose my sanity.

I’m grateful for my life and I understand it’s a really good one, but I can’t help the fact that I’m depressed and unhappy. I just want her to stop accidentally guilting me for it.

53,"This is going to be a bit long winded and for that I am sorry. But you taking the time to read this, means the world to me. It all started when I was 12. I suffered a partial dislocation of the knee called a subluxation. Very jarringly painful especially for a pre teen. My parents never did take health problems very serious and because of that my condition worsened over my early years until it was too late, I lost my medical insurance before even getting a propper diagnosis. But I know what my problem is by deductive reasoning. 

I have hEDS (a painful and serious type of hypermobility) I know because 
1: It is hereditary or however that is spelled, runs in the family rather
2: I show most signs for this condition
3: I can't give plasma because of a ""protien irregularity"" as the clinics have put it. Which is a huge red flag that one has this condition. 
4: A doctor I am unable to afford to see again just yet told me they believe I do have this problem. 

Now that said, I have done a LOT to work with and around it. I do solo physical theropy every other day. I eat healthier. I try my best to be upbeat and happy and not let my condition bring others down. But it got way harder about 5 years ago. Let me explain. 

Five years ago I went through a very hard breakup. I lost the will to live so long I actually had a heart attack. That heart attack killed me for a little over 3 mins and gave me brain dammage, enough so that I now have severe short term memory loss. I have lost upwards of 3 hours in an instant. I do brain teasers and try my best to combat it but im losing to my depression and living situation. I have never recovered emotionally from that whole experience and I don't know who or how to open up about it to.

You see when you can't work, have no dissability or medical insurance, and have been abused so much in the past that you become physically violant when yelled at, nobody wants you to live with them. And nobody wants to help you if you do a good job at the housework you do to ""earn your keep"" that or they don't have the time. I recently moved again to a friends and they haven't even been able to get my belongings from my sisters house because of birthday parties, dates, family issues etc. of their own. Which I respect... But it has been weeks.

I now fear love to the point that I actively sabbotage any hopes of romance in my life. Everyone thinks i'm a virgin or gay im so odd about it now and it's been so long sense I've been with anyone I can't blame them. I can't stand without my body searing in pain. I only sleep 2-3hrs a day due to night terrors from my death and bad joints. I can't drive and even if I could my only worldly posession is a harmonica that my friend got me, a few outfits, and a wallet with my id and ssn card. I fear opening up, I fear being homeless, and I fear dying alone again. I don't want to be a burden on people anymore. I don't want to feel sorry to others for existing anymore. I have tried and failed at suicide though i have never been cought. I gave up on that. But I feel myself losing the will to live again. Please just tell me there is hope.

I’ve had untreated depression for several years now. I’ve finally taken the steps to get myself help and have started seeing a therapist. I am doing the exercises she gave me and trying to get away from the negative thoughts, but somehow I feel as if I’ve gotten worse. Some days I truly feel like I have lost control over my mind because of the thoughts I have. It’s gotten to the point where I’m driving my fiancé away from me and making her not want to be with me any longer. I just don’t know what to do. I’m tired of feeling this way, I’m tired of fighting with myself on a daily basis. I need to get myself better for not only my health, but the health of my relationship that I do not want to lose. 

My fiancé has also struggled with depression/anxiety. I dealt with hers firsthand after her father unexpectedly passed away. There was a period of two months after he died that she would barely leave the house, get out of bed, she lost all sexual attraction to me. While it was extremely difficult, I just stayed strong for her and carried a lot on my shoulders for the next year. Now, when I’m in a position of vulnerability, I feel like she has completely distanced herself from me and is tired of dealing with me and my depression. I guess I just want to know if I’m wrong for feeling like she doesn’t care or is like downplaying my depression? I’m not sure how to describe her behavior but to me it feels like the total opposite of what I did when her depression got really bad.

I then went on to talk about my executive dysfunction problems because I took another MMPI and scored pretty high on the depression questions even on medication, likely due to the amount of shit that’s been piling up because I just can’t force myself to do it. Even when I set incentives and rewards, I still won’t do it because im a little shit and I don’t respect the person making the rules (me). 

I think he thought it was funny? I definitely did, but either way I definitely need to take a closer look at the depression and stuff. I thought about a hospital visit but I’m not actively suicidal and I don’t want to put that on my family or boyfriend/friends. Guess I’ll just keep laughing at my failures 🙃",Called myself a little shit in therapy today,1

One of them is simple. Studies and the university. I'm practically in my last year but one of the subjects is frustrating to the extreme. Due to the nature of the subject, I can only work on it effectively in class, but it's hard, the teacher barely explains the theory behind it, and I can't even Google the answers due to an NDA. Even if I study 5 hours away from my parents' house, I'm still living there for economical reasons and COVID, and adding up that we got too few subject hours thanks to local festivities, I can barely even work in it. Tomorrow is the deadline, and I hit a brick wall that I can't cross before the deadline, so that's game over.


On the other hand, I have role playing as a hobby. From years I have been interpreting characters to pass the time, and with one person in particular I has more fun than the rest. We even got a point where we would role play in chat all the time. A few months back we made with a third friend of ours a role playing forum and we have returned to Rome playing in that medium too. Some of the people there got really friendly with us and started chatting, making group calls, tabletop Games, the like. 

... But then, I started to feel distance. Some of the things they did in group, I didn't find fun or I couldn't enter because I was busy with something else. I brought it up after a breakdown, and it got better in that regard... But the person I role played with has practically stopped role playing with me. Chat rolls took hours if not days to be answered, and even in the forum, our characters barely interacted or did in an antagonistic way, but even that has been slowed down. I'm still waiting for her answers in the few role threads we have... 

We had a heated argument with this (not the whole thing, but the ""no positive character interaction"" part more specifically and not making any characters around mine) when I was already in a bad mood with the University, and nothing has changed. They said that they feel burned out with our old characters, and even if at the heat of the moment I got angry, I understand it now. I have tried to think of new plot points or characters to do, but they have barely answered me positively in any of them, and the only one has to go to the drawer because they want to try it on the forum and doesn't have any needs to create a new character in there.

... I just want to return to that chat. To have fun in it, and it's harder and harder each day it passes. I'm even starting to think that they are avoiding me, but I know it's not true. I feel too frenetic about it that each time something of this regard surfaces in my mind I feel like crap for the rest of the day. I lose all my energy and I even feel desperate for *any* progress with them that never seems to happen.

94,"Earlier tonight, my young sister and I had a very nasty confrontation and it lead to me having to call the police. She initiated it due to hearing me angrily vent to our parents about how fed up I was about manipulative and abusive things that she has continuously done to me for years, and how she has made no effort at all to change her ways. Once she inserted herself into our conversation it all went downhill from there. She threatened me, called me names and then physically attacked me. Both of our parents had to intervene and it took both of combined efforts to pull her off of me and get her to stop. She’s larger than I am in both weight and stature, and she could’ve hurt me pretty badly had she not been stopped when she was. (This has actually happed to me before btw, and I was left with two black eyes and a busted lip) As a result of her actions, I had to call the police. 

While on the phone she continued calling me names, cussing me out, making threats, and even threw my previous history of mental health struggles and suicide attempts in my face to further insult and humiliate me. She even went as far as to say that she didn’t care if I called the cops, and that I was crazy, and how no one would believe me. She continued by saying that both of our parents would back her up. 

During all of this, I was gaslit our parents. I was basically called a traitor for calling 911, and told that I had no family loyalty. My sister and I are both grown adults, and yet they made excuses for her actions, and downplayed them by referring to what took place tonight as “typical sibling rivalry” instead of acknowledging it as domestic violence. They said that I tried to ruin her life and should be ashamed of myself for getting “the man” involved in family business. They refused to see her actions as abusive, and instead felt it necessary tell me how horrible I am for not just letting her beat the shit out of me and getting over it. After some pleading from our parents, my sister was given a warning and not arrested, which admittedly I’m somewhat relieved about as I don’t want her to have a criminal record. However, I don’t want to be beaten anymore and feel unsafe in my home. A part of me feels like that this is all going to happen again and nothing will be learned from it.

100,"WARNING: VERY LONG POST

This year I began seeing a counselor and was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, better known as Clinical Depression.  I've been depressed most of my life and I've battled deep-rooted problems with my self-worth for a very long time. I'm 23 and most of my life I've wondered why things have to be the way they are. 

For starters, my parents decided to try having a kid thinking it would save their dying marriage. Considering they divorced barely 2 years later, I guess it didn't work. I love my parents and I appreciate everything they do. They've helped with everything from financial hurdles, to advice on my career and in life in general, to just sitting there and talking with me when I've needed someone who'd listen. But I'm also aware that they've hurt me and abused me for much of my life. My mother and father were broken people for much of my childhood. My mom struggled with drugs and drinking, and my father suffered from brutal alcoholism. My mom was controlling and emotionally abusive, always losing her temper and yelling at me, saying terrible things and making me feel like I was an awful exuse for a son. My father was and still is very emotionally distant, always holding me at arm's length and never hesitates to criticize me. He rarely seems truly happy to see me or spend time with me. 

Over time they'd both get their lives together and get sober, and for that I'm truly proud of both of them. My mom's 11 years clean and sober and my dad's 4 years sober. But I still feel the effects of all their neglect and mistreatment to this day. It probably didn't help that closest thing I've had to a relationship was one-sided and abusive, and I walked out of that experience a broken man. That was 3 and a half years ago and I'm still very hesitant to even think of  dating ever again. I'm constantly doubting my worth to myself and to others. I'm afraid for for my future. I worry that I mean nothing to the people that I admire despite how silly it sounds. My friends plan gatherings with no intention of including me, and I when I tried reaching out to one of my friends about my struggles, I was told that I talk too much and perhaps that was the reason why they rarely share their experiences with me. My roommate was one of my best friends at one point, and he was even the first person I shared my diagnosis with. He rarely checks in on me and largely seems to ignore what I go through.

This was the year I began thinking about killing myself. I have no intention to, nor do I want to. I'm aware that suicide DOES NOTHING to solve my problems and that I'd inflict unspeakable grief on anyone that's ever cared for me. I know all this, but the thought of it still haunts me on my worst days. What keeps me going is the support of  my mentor, my friends who make a legitimate effort to stay in touch with me and see me when they can, and my faith in the good Lord who made me. I never asked for this burden of emotional instability, but I hope I can spend my life learning to live with myself, learning to truly love myself, and be a source of support and counsel to those who fight this same battle everyday.","My story, and my situation.",1

107," 

Hello everyone, I don't know if this is the right subreddit but I truly need to get things off my chest. Any insight that might help me think clearly is highly appreciated. I am sorry this will a little long but I just want to get things off my chest.

I am confused, depressed, anxious and lost. I have always been a premed. I excelled in highschool and the first 3 years of college. I was a 4.0 as a junior in college in 2014. I took my mcat back then without the right preparation and I scored horribly. I was discouraged and I was never the same student after that. At the same time I was a shy and insecure guy, I was told that I was good looking but I had no experience with girls and I was easily intimidated by people. fast forward to 2015, I started partying and getting drunk, dropped all my science classes, received a bunch of Bs and a C in the following semester and never attempted to study for the mcat. in 2016 I managed to complete my coursework and graduated with 3.7, I never studied for the mcat, barely studied and wasted months simping over a girl and overthinking. I did not attempt to change majors because I thought that I will get back on track eventually. I graduated, got a job but turned it down so I can move the city and live with friends and eventually study for the mcat instead of working. I moved, wasted time, spent long hours in depression and overthinking, partied a little and at that point I wasn't a shy boy anymore, I was more outgoing and better looking.

I eventually left the US for 9 moths and lived with my parents in my home country because I thought that I will study. I spent months and hours upon hours in coffee shops "" studying"", but in fact I was thinking, meeting new people and doing everything except for studying. In the end I was depressed and decided that it was time to go back to my undergrad school city. This time I got a part time job as tutor, working 20 hours/week with the hope that I will use the extra time to study for the mcat. I worked on uber for 3 months but I stopped because I did not want to damage the car. Guess what happened, yes, I wasted the last 3 years (end of 2017,2018, 2019, 2020) wasting time at coffee shops, sitting there, getting bursts of motivation for a month, studying hard, then stopping for 2 months, then starting over. if I add up everything I studied, I can say that I finished everything, but I do not recall anything because it was spread out and more importantly I did not have a dedicated time where I sat down for 3 months and did tons of practice.

I feel like a loser yet I know that I would love to be a doctor. I lost all the motivation. I feel left out. my friends are all MDs now, I did better than all my friends in college, I accumulated more than 1000 hours of volunteer work and extracurriculars, research, etc.. BUT i quit, I was weak, I am a 27 years old loser. I regret not finding something else to do, I have the intellectual ability, I excelled in a very competitive program, but I lacked the drive, the discipline and the work ethic. Moreover, I want to be a physician, I think it is a noble career, i love applying sciences, interacting with patients and giving back even on a small scale. I am typing right now as I am ""studying"". I know, doing the same thing expecting different results. I keep giving myself chances and opportunities than things will get better and I will finish eventually, but here I am, 6 years after my first mcat and I am still the same guy, with extra debt, no career, just a dream that remained a dream.

I want to make money as well, I feel like at 27 I should have at least had a good career going on if im not in medicine. I am 27 and if everything goes well now I will start medicine at 29 and be done at 33 then 36-37 for residency. This is the best case scenario. I am afraid of failure, I am afraid that I will not take the mcat in the first place. I feel old and behind. I have no savings, I ruined my relationships and I am still doing that part time job. I just could not think of anyone who's more of a loser than myself. I have friends are 22 and making 90k and 100k, friends my age are either in residency or making 6 figures and have families. I have nothing. I keep thinking about the past, and worrying about the future.

I got accepted to a masters program in business analytics, I have friends who got good jobs and it is something that I see myself doing. It is intellectually stimulating. But every time I think about it, the fear kicks in, I am too old to even start, I will not get a good job, I do not have connections to get a good job, what if I regret my decision at 35 by me saying that I could have been a doctor, I would love to be a doctor, etc.. I applied as a plan B yet I am scared. I have wanted to be a doctor ever since highschool, I am sad that I did not even try to retake the test, but when I think about it I get scared that I will fail and even if I get in I will regret not getting a corporate job instead of ruining my mental state with years of torture. I was very confident in my capabilities in the first 3 years of college, I have zero confidence in myself now.

111,"TW: Suicidal ideation and being near weapons

I've been on Prozac since late 2017, it's been three years but sometimes I feel like nothing has changed. My parents say it has changed and I don't verbally show it as much but it's still there. I think about killing myself more. And I feel like I flip between loving and hating people around me more, even my therapist and my boyfriend. Sometimes I just stare at my dad's gun. I feel like I even scare my boyfriend because I pull an idiot and text him when I'm upset just venting

I don't want to be on my medication anymore Three whole years and I feel like there is very little true progress being made. It makes me act better, not think better. That doesn't help me if I can hear my own brain and it screams at me. My boyfriend and parents have very different views. He wants me to stop and have him take care of me when I'm upset, and they don't think I should try going off it without doctor's approval. I think I should stay on it until my doctor says so but I'm just stuck and with how I think now, going off it doesn't seem like it'd be too different.

I'd like to hear your advice. Is this a common feeling in long term anti-anxiety or antidepressant users? I think some solutions would be looking for other supports or talking with my doctor about my dosage. But is any sort of plan for going off it in the future a bad one?","I've been on my medication for three years now, does it ever stop?",1
112,"Tw: suicide

Hi guys. This is a throwaway/backup account because I'm super embarrassed by this and feel like a weirdo. Long story short, I have depression and anxiety, I have cerebral palsy and I've always struggled making friends. I've been in a few relationships but nothing major. I've always felt like the world hates me and whenever something good happens something always ruins it. 

Back in May 2018, I fell in love with a fictional character. I just thought it was a silly, little crush as I've had loads of crushes on fictional characters before. But this became a bit more strong than that. I think what attracted me to this character so much is cos he was struggling with similar mental health issues. Then he died by suicide in one episode and it was actually quite widely talked about and the actor was praised for the performance. However, every time someone talked about it or about the character, I'd feel like crying and need to go somewhere private. It made me sick to my stomach. Why didn't any one help him? I would have helped him if I was there. That was when it started.

I would think about the show/the character twenty four seven. I then created a little character of my own who lived on the same street as he did on the show. In my head, she was a much better version of myself, she was somewhat confident and good looking yet she had underlying mental health issues. I was so intrigued with my little creation and constantly pictured her interacting with other characters on the show. I'd escape to this little world a lot and I loved it. 

I decided to to kick it up a notch and wrote a story about the character struggling with her mental illness and everyone on the show being oblivious at first but then understanding. She got extremely close to a character on the show and they became best mates in my head. All was well. Until a character was introduced on the show in real life and kind of took over the 'best mate' role. I remember being so angry and... jealous? It sounds so stupid but I actually cried because I felt like an actual real life friend had been stolen from me. 
Then said character developed the same mental health issues my escape character did and what freaked me out is that there was a scene in the show that played out exactly as it did in my head with my escape character. Cue me getting upset again. I had no idea why I was so upset, it's stupid. I just felt like my escape character (better me) was being pushed aside. It happened again with another character on the show and I got extremely jealous of him too but with a different storyline/issue because so many people were supporting and comforting him which I've never had.

I got rid of this fictional world from my head for a while but then it came back last Christmas. I had dreams about this fictional world. I constantly tweeked my escape character to match what was going on in the show at the present time. If a character was killed off I'd remove them and replace them with a different one in my head when thinking of interactions.
I even remember jumping for joy when a character with similar looks/facial features to mine/me left the show. How ridiculous is that?

However, a couple of days back. My whole world was destroyed. When a character with the same name, similar voice  and looks joined the show. I felt like my heart had been shredded. She was gone. The better me had been stolen/replaced. I remember feeling so ill and tearful when I saw the character announcement. I feel like I've lost a friend! It sounds stupid. But my escape character was my only friend.
I've been so depressed. I've been really upset all the time. I know it's stupid. My character was never going to be made reality. But she felt like she was...

Has anyone else had anything like this? I feel so down and upset over it. My depression is back at full force. I know she wasn't real but I feel like that better version of me is gone forever.
I feel like I've fell in love with the show itself because I really want to be in that world.",A crush on a fictional character became my only happy place but now I feel awful,1

121,"Pleasant aesthetics, and that includes sounds, images and the whole human bodily sensory relationship, is the closest thing to divinity that we have. The good relationship between the information presented and its aspect impacted on our mind and body, creates an ethereal bridge for the appreciation of beauty as ""good functional"", or ""symmetry well adjusted to its respective well-achieved purpose"". The definition of art would be precisely the manifestation of the beautiful in all its possible facets and conjunctures. For the existence of the beautiful and all its mystical and ritualistic contemplation, which create true spiritual effects for those who feel its manifestation. Many endure the suffering and painful parts of life just by the mere thought that the beautiful exists; I understand this reasoning, but it must not be good for the one who suffers the most and does not see this beauty expressed in his life at all.

Then the pandemic hit. We stayed together through it, and things seemed fine. But over time we started to fight and argue. About politics. About this and that. Early September, I broke it off with her.

For nearly 2 months things seemed fine. I tried to move on. Got on dating apps, asked a friend out on a date. No luck. I began to get lonely. I asked if she would speak with me. She agreed.

We met a few weeks ago, and she had changed. She was more confident, more social, and more cold. She explained to me what she went through after we broke up. How hurt she was. How she suffered. We talked, and everything seemed okay, everything was civil. She also had a new boyfriend.

We parted that night feeling as if it went well. However, something was eating at me.

Last night it came to a head. I felt like shit. I wish I could have been there for her. How could I have left her? I got a big head thinking that I could find someone better, but really she was the only person that ever did or ever could love me like that.

Why would she lie about being raped, having Tourettes, being abused? I trusted her and she broke my trust so hard, I comforted her, took her to the police when she needed help.

I was in this relationship with this girl who was my friend since freshman year, I became a lot closer with her and eventually we became a thing. Dated for about 2 months which I know isn’t long but I was actually happy for a little bit, our relationship started off a little weird and she was super manipulative and tried to hide us being together. She wanted to continue going to see her ex and hang out with old friends she used to hookup with, which was super odd to me but I didn’t want to “control” her so I kinda let it slide. She started talking to my best friend and they became really close to the point where all she would talk about was him, and this was only a month in our relationship. I am not the type to ever express my feelings to someone because that’s not who I am but I thought I could trust her with that, I told her everything that made me upset, sad, the constant being made fun of when I was younger and how that made me feel super self conscious about myself. She started to use the things that made me sad against me and I couldn’t handle it anymore, I knew that my best friend and her were already close so there was no point in putting myself in that kind of situation. I ended things with her and her and my best friend started dating a week after :/ I was kinda lost I didn’t know how to feel or how to handle it so I just completely cut ends with him. Not to mention she was my first everything, my first “I love you”, I know that’s early but I knew this girl for so long so it kinda felt right but it was also mutual.

136,"Let me start by saying I am horrible at sharing what I feel, and I am tearing up just writing this out. Anyways, I’ll start.

In May, my girlfriend of 2 years and I broke up due to her not being able to deal with my depression/anxiety/lack of emotion.   I sincerely believe the medication I was on robbed me of my humanity.   I just felt....out of it.  I was tired all the fucking time.  

It sucks that she couldn’t see that I could get better.  I tried so hard after she brought up that I wasn’t the same anymore.  I realized that I wasn’t myself.   So I stopped the medication and, within a month, I could *feel* again.

But she was already too far gone.  I honestly still cannot fully understand how or why she could lose feelings for me like that.  It still hurts.   A lot of the pain comes from me not being able to remember much of our relationship.  Like, I can’t remember what we did for birthdays, Valentine’s Day, or even Christmas.   It just hurts.

But I can’t do anything about that, I’ve tried so damn hard too.

Following...all that....I just kept working in the pharmacy at the hospital.   I didn’t really feel as tired anymore, and I just...I wanted to share the person I now was with her. I felt like I was me again.  I could tear up listening to music again...

But things just didn’t work out the way I’d’ve hoped and she was just having none of it.   At this point, I am not sure she even wants to be friends, which hurts in its own way.

Fast forward to September, I get sick at work.  I honestly think it is COVID.  I contact the scheduling supervisor and say I am going to get a COVID test.  I get it.  It comes back negative after 3 days.

I return to work as-scheduled the following Monday (I was off the weekend) and get told I had been let go for not showing up to work for 3 days straight.  What in the actual fuck.

I didn’t really know what to do.  I just felt defeated.  It makes me just...not want to do anything in the medical field anymore: patients are not thankful and the whole culture is just kind of toxic so much of the time.   It is so draining.  All I wanted was to help people man.

I had enrolled in a couple online classes just to have something else to do after work. It also had the benefit of putting off student loan payments for awhile so that was nice seeing as I didn’t have a fucking job.

I hardly left my house.  I only really left my bed to shower once or twice a day and that was it.   I used to play semi-professional and collegiate soccer...but I feel horrendously unfit.  I still do.



Anyways, now that I’ve typed all that out, I don’t know if this ending makes me feel as good as I’d like, but it still feels like I DID SOMETHING:

I have gotten 100% or more on each one of my tests so far, and I have actually worked ahead in my class so much that all there is left for me to do is take the Final Exam and that’s it.

I used to be so good at those kinds of things and it makes me slightly happy to know I can still do it.

I still do wish I could share my excitement with her though.

I am always so alone and feel like I'm being left behind.. everybody's going on whilst I am feeling stuck. This makes me mad and sad.. cause nobody cares enough to come ask me if I am okay.. or if I need help... Or if they can wait for me.. 

I am sad because the people I thought would do it, just goes on without me.. and its ALWAYS MY FAULT.  Its always my fault because I am too sensitive to life and it's my fault for not being able to do things..

145,"Broken girl 
She’s so broken by her past she can barely be present, more often times present in what’s bad like she only decides to feel the pain to reassure herself how bad this world truly is.
Life is beautiful If you know where to look, blinded by anxiety fear and depression it’s so hard to locate the beauty. She tries and tries but always the wrong time or place, she feels like she can never win. Every break seems so short lived every good moment passes by in a breeze. But the bad oh we dwell on the bad for as long as we can so it’s sharp in my memory so we can look back on. When will we ever learn when will we decide enough is enough and I’m going to take a stand and try to put these pieces back together. Broken people tend to break people so they can feel whole again, but it truly never works. They just end up hurting people that are there for them in turn to make them do the same it’s like some sort of vampire line of misery we try to pass on. We know what to do we know what’s right but why do we feel empty when we do it. Why does it not bring us joy to make other people happy. Was something taken from us? Time heals all wounds but I just don’t know if this wound will ever heal! I feel alone shattered, lost confused frustrated miserable. Why? Why can’t I live a normal life? I guess not everything was meant to be the same. Maybe that’s why I feel comfort in the shadows, why I can’t hurt no one so it makes me feel better, and why I can just hurt myself. But that’s not the answer. Hurting myself or anyone isn’t the answer. That’s what fuels my depression and my insecurities. The lack of self communication and reassurance or even with someone else. Being able to have a dialogue about things not being okay but understanding that I can get thru it and not point blame anywhere especially on myself. I can’t keep beating myself up or else pretty soon there won’t be much left of me. I’m truly disintegrating and I’m scared and relieved. Stuck between so many paths and so many emotions I can’t tell what is real anymore. 
I pray everything changes, and I start to embrace my truth and seek and receive what is meant for me. I will try and be open minded and optimistic even tho my demons are telling me otherwise. I will continue to fight until I can’t anymore and I know some days I won’t have the energy to at all. I have to be okay with this and keep moving forward. And at the end of the day if I can be whole again, I just hope I can help someone reach the same so we can start are own link. We can place these broken pieces in the recycle for other people to use to become whole again. That way one day we won’t have people feeling the way I do and if we do they can see that it doesn’t have to always be this way. We can be the light to guide someone out the darkness because I too didn’t think it was possible but I’ll be there to show them it is.",“Broken” Girl/Guy,1
146,"These last few weeks have probably been some of the worst in my entire life. And it’s all about a girl. I just cant fucking stop thinking about her. I don’t even want to move on. I know that if I don’t move on I’ll just always feel like this but I can’t, and I don’t want to. I think about her all day to this point and have even told her how I feel, twice. I was kinda hoping she’d just ghost me the second time but she still wants to be my friend. This fucking situation has me hating so many people (myself included). I don’t even want it to end though. I just want to be with her. I’ll probably end up deleting this post quickly after I post it because I don’t want anyone I know to see me this desperate. I just can’t fucking do it, I am starting to believe that I’m genuinely in hell. I let myself be sad for one fucking moment and now I can’t feel anything else but longing and loneliness. People say not to bottle your emotions but anytime I let myself feel I end up staying in my room all day. I need to try to get therapy when I get home from college but I don’t know where to start, and I don’t even know if it would help. I end up wishing that I had someone else’s life, and hating my own. I want to improve my life so fucking badly. I worry though because with each (daily) depressive episode I think about suicide, and on some days I actually tell myself I’ll do it. I don’t want to die before I have a chance to improve my life. Fuck. Everything I do makes it worse. I just want to be with her.",I’m in hell,1
147,"Real depression is truly hell. Feeling suicidal is scary. I'm going through another episode now of it. When im really depressed I dont eat properly, as I have no appetite, so I lose weight. When you lose weight you feel weak which only adds to feeling crappy. Depression is unlike any other health condition because we are our minds, our minds are everything.

People suffer for years with it and it can be harder as you get older. I'm ashamed to admit how many years I've been out of work and drifting but nearly a decade. I live in England and have been on low level sickness benefits due to a breakdown in the past. There is so much I could say about my past, feelings of being a bad person, feelings of guilt and shame over things that come back to the surface in spite of talking it all out with people/professionals

Once again I'm in a dark place, lying in bed with a knot in my stomach. I don't take anti depressants simply because in the last 25 years I must have tried 5 different ones and some made me worse which you can't afford to feel, others did little apart from foginess. They scare me now, if they work for you that's good. I'm slowly getting older and I can tell you it gets harder dealing with this as you get a little older because you start to lose faith in things ever changing. There are so many things from my past that I struggle to let go of. I've done counselling, seen psychologists and I have no problem opening up to friends or family on most things. 

Its difficult, recovering my life from years of unemployment and the madness I feel at times in my head feels like climbing Everest. Real Depression is truly the worst feeling ever as it saps your energy, wrecks concentration and steals time from your life.

Although most if my life from the age of about 16 has felt like a struggle there has been brief periods where I somehow made progress or so I thought. I was married for a short time and have a son who's nearly 15, I dont see him so much as he lives with his mum a 3 hour car drive away. I have no car so I get the train very occasionally. Although I've been told I'm decent looking, because of my struggles I've only had a few relationships in my whole life, most of my 20s I was single/unable to have a relationship due to low self esteem, lack of confidence and other issues. I've been single for about 7 years now too. My best years, no love, sex or any of the good stuff of a loving relationship. Years I can never get back 

I'm not sure of the purpose of this post as I know that no one has a magic key, neither do I want to come across as 'poor me' as I'm aware people have much worse lives for various reasons in life

I just wanted to share my story and say that depression and despair scares me knowing the dark places it has taken me including a short hospital stay 8 years ago where I was on the edge, and where it can lead.

148,"Frankly, I don’t know where to begin. This has been very hard for me to write. It is also my first reddit post. I don’t really know if this is the right subreddit for me, but anyone who reads this is greatly appreciated; Thank you so much for listening to what I have to say. Forgive me if it gets messy at times; I am doing my best to organise my many thoughts.

I’m 22 (M). Last week I realised that addiction to porn and masturbation was affecting my schoolwork really badly. I had traced it to my bad relationship with sex and the opposite gender, which brought me a lot of shame, especially because I have close female friends whom I had objectified repeatedly in my head.

When I brought this up to my then-girlfriend of 8 years, she told me that she was struggling with control tendencies too. She had just started work and it had been a really tough period. She has a history of cheating, and she told me that she can feel her urges coming back. She told me that she was thinking of ending it for good, and I decided that it was the right thing to do. For real this time.

We found a compromise in talking to each other when we thought it was necessary (with boundaries, of course). We had broken up twice before because she cheated, and both breakups were not smooth. Being together for so long makes you realise that nobody knows you better than she does, and I could use the help. The past few months had been relatively emotionally distant, so breaking up and talking wasn’t as hard as before.

Since then, I’ve been trying to fix my issue with sex and my relationship with women. I’ve controlled my disrespectful thoughts about women, and I’m slowly getting out of masturbation (I only do it to soothe withdrawals, and when I do, my head is empty, and I don’t feel much). I’ve been doing a lot of journalling; it helps me think. I’ve been eating well and sleeping well.

Yesterday, I apologised to my ex for all the things I did wrong to her in order to deal with my issues with shame; the list is unfathomable. I won’t go into the details, but I had continually manipulated her and robbed her of her sexual freedom. I also had the exact same sexual urges that she did, especially with regard to cheating. I also did cheat on her during our relationship, something that I had chosen to hide this whole time. The two times we had broken up before, I had made her out to be the bad guy, even on the second time when she had confessed her cheating on her own accord. She went through her own psychological trauma, and it affected our relationship really badly, simply because I was a coward. The list goes on.

Today, I talked to her about it again. It went well. She told me that she was glad that we were having the conversation because we hadn’t been this honest in a long time.

All of a sudden, I started to cry.

It was at this moment I realised that I have lied about so many things my whole life and gotten away with them. It was at this moment I realised I was a habitual liar.

The first lie I ever told was to my parents. I was always told from a young age how smart and capable I was. When I was young, my family had moved overseas for work and I had gone to preschool there. When we came back, I hated the school here, but I did not want my parents to think that I was incapable. The first lie I ever told was that I enjoyed school.

I remember the first traumatic experience in my life, grappling and fighting as hard as I could in front of the school doors, clinging for my life to my mother while the teachers were pulling me into the school.

I had always been a sociable kid, though. I managed to find solace and ego in talking to my friends. I would talk in class and get told off for it, but I never did that badly in school, so I would get away with it.

This continued into primary school. Before the mid-year holidays in Primary 1 (I was 7), my teacher had given us this workbook where all we had to do was tear out the worksheets and staple each set together. Because I did not pay attention in class, I had left the book in my locker, and when I had realised, I was too ashamed to tell my parents. I never confronted this book, and I couldn’t do any of the worksheets that we were supposed to do because of it. Every time the teacher asked me where it was, I made up some excuse. Even when they told my parents that I had not been doing the work, I just kept making excuses.

And I got away with it. After the final year exams, I was second in class, even though I had not submitted any of the work. I even received a trophy for it.

I proceeded to avoid all my work throughout primary school and lie about it. I started to realise that I could lie in social situations too and get away with it. This continued into high school. This was when I met my ex-girlfriend.

If there is a God, he must be doing wonders for me because I have no idea how I have made it this far. I do not know how I have managed to surround myself with such supportive friends and family who have been patient with me and helped me come to this realisation. I am most of all fortunate to have spent these years with my ex, whose constant love and patience with me have allowed me to be in this very moment writing this without self-destructing.

I am still in the process of figure it all out. I know what needs to be done, and I know I have what it takes to pick up the pieces. Everything is still very fresh, and probably will be for a very long time. I am committed to making things right however I can.

I am also in the process of looking for professional help. I never thought I needed therapy, but the situation has revealed itself to be way worse than I imagined.

This is all I have to write for now. If you have read this far, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to share this with you. Your listening ear is more than enough support for me.",Today I recognised that I am a habitual liar. I have been living a lie my whole life.,1
149,"This is a very difficult post for me to make I am very embarrassed in my actions but I feel like I’m running out of any and all positive thoughts. Back in July I was living in Arizona with a few roommates and everything was fine, at least on the surface. For most of my life I was an atheist, but turned Christian after getting high on LSD a few times. During this time I started reading into various conspiracy theories and took them way too seriously. Long story short I went absolutely insane and it led to me losing the apartment I was in at the time. After about a month of staying with a friend I got a new apartment but this time just me and my fiancé at the time (the relationship is over now). I swore to myself that I wouldn’t fall into the same pitfalls again but I did. Stress from needing to catch up on debt and stress of being totally isolated due to COVID caused me to fall back into my psychosis I and up and left my lease, I told my super religious mother to help me move back to where I grew up because I was afraid that somehow the world was ending because I was reading too much into Bible prophecy. I then got picked up and took a flight to Vermont to live with my grandparents.

I used to have a really good job that covered everything but in my delusion I completely left that as well. Now I’m starting working at a McDonalds but the damage to my credit is already being done. Plus the consequences of me leaving my lease still haven’t hit which I can imagine are probably going to be absolutely devastating. I owe over $1000 each month in just my various minimum payments on credit cards, a loan on a Mac and musical equipment I started payment plans on, and a phone bill.

Point is I feel like an absolute failure of a human being, I don’t think there’s really any way to fix the damage I’ve done, and anyone reading this knows I am an absolute IDIOT. What value do I really have to the world when I’m this stupid? I’m 23 now and I know I can’t even DREAM of getting a new apartment until I’m at least 30 because of the broken lease on my report. I’ll probably never be able to have a relationship again because what woman would want to associate with a fuck up like myself. Is there really even a point in me trying to fix my life? I feel absolutely hopeless and I pray to not wake up almost every night. I’m currently living in my Grandparents living room, absolutely lost and hopeless. I’m not being lazy about it, I only took McDonalds because they’re the only ones that will hire me after how I left my last employer, and in the area I live in theres not many jobs to begin with, and everything paying better that I applied for doesn’t respond to me. I’m using YouTube videos to learn to write Java and I intend to take computer science courses when I can so I can at least have a profitable skill.

However I don’t have a whole bunch of self faith, and I absolutely despise myself. Does anyone on here think I have any sort of hope of having a life I can be proud of or am I destined to be a bottom feeding failure for the rest of it?",Mental Breakdowns Ruined My Life.,1

I just feel like maybe, if I was good enough, he would spend more time with me.

Logically, I *know* he loves me. He's said it enough times and wants to be with me forever. I have no doubt there. Yet, I still feel so unloved sometimes, and it makes me feel so selfish. He's going to be going to college next year in a different state, and I know I'm going to see him even less than I do now.

156,"I had a baby in September, so for someone who's literally never alone, I feel pretty damn lonely. 

I'm a single mom living with my parents in the middle of a pandemic. I'm locked away in my bedroom for 6-8 of my waking hours to breastfeed my daughter, getting absolutely no human interaction. Plus, she doesn't go to bed until like 10pm and by then I'm ready for bed too because we're up at 8am every day. So basically I spent 16-18 hours of a 24 hour day with no one but my baby. 

My parents said they'd help out so much when I was pregnant but now that the baby is here, they haven't even changed a single diaper. My dad will hold her for maybe a half hour but that only happens once or twice a week. My mom holds her for like an hour a day and most of that is in like 10 minute increments while I do laundry or go to the bathroom. I get no real breaks. 

My baby's dad wants nothing to do with her. I left him when I got pregnant but I didn't expect him to not care about the baby at all. 

My best friend of 13 years just straight up ignored my texts. Her and her fiancé  bought my daughter something with her name on it so I sent her a picture of my daughter wearing it and thanked my friend for it, that was like a week ago and no response. I'm honestly shocked by it. I know everyone has friends that kinda fade out once they have kids but I never thought my best friend would do that. 

I haven't been able to go back to work. Once things started opening back up in my state, I was like 37 weeks pregnant and I didn't want to go back to work for just a couple weeks. Now that it's about time for me to go back to work, everything's shutting down again. I was really looking forward to doing something for myself again, even if it's only for 20 hours a week. 

I've been depressed for years but not anything like this. I've never wanted to just break down and cry for no reason at all. And I think that's the worst part, I don't think I've cried since the first week my daughter was born and now she's two months old. I want to cry but I just can't. Like somethings blocking me from crying but I don't know what. 

My whole life I wanted to be a mom so badly and now that it's happening, I'm too sad to enjoy it. It's to the point where I know I can never have another baby. I can't feel like this again, I won't be able to handle it. I used to want a house full of kids but I don't even know how I'm gonna manage to raise this one. I thought I'd be happier as a mom, I love kids so much. I love my baby more than anything in this world but god, I'm so alone and so, so sad.

159,"Hello reddit community. This will be the first time in my life that I have ever reached out to a forum for help; and as short as I’ll try to keep it, please bare with me if I leave a boring and lengthy summary of my life. With the understanding that everyone has suffering and problems, I am writing this post to explain my story and my problems, and what has led me here to this day of my life that I plan to close my story.

I’d like to begin my story with the heart of all my issues, and that was the abuse I experienced as a child. When I was 3 years old my mother cheated and chose drugs/alcohol and my parents split. I went with my father and he met a new woman when I was 5. This woman tortured me for years, mentally and physically. I was chased around the home with knives, stripped naked and forced to stand in the snow for hours, forced to eat my own throw up, forced to do sexual things, told everyday why my mother hated me and why nobody loved me. I was too young to know better but I spoke with elementary school counselors everyday and cried to them, DCFS came to my home many times and my father did not believe me nor did anyone else. Everyone said I was lying because I missed my mother. It got to the point that I didn’t know what was true anymore. This has caused me issues throughout my adult life. I am unable to be true to myself and I lie to everyone even for no reason at all. I make up stories in my head and believe them. Back to my story, eventually I was old enough(11) that I told my father at the dinner table that if they would not let me go that night I was going to fight with my counselors to be put in adoption. Low behold, all the lies they told me over the years about my mother they had a way to reach her the entire time (mind you at this point in my life I had only seen my mother once since my parents had split. So they called my mother and she came to pick me up and I went to live with her. My mother was at her worst. She was a damaged woman, her children taken from her, her life consumed with drugs and sex. I believe she loved me but she was so far gone that we were starving during my duration with her. She’d disappear nights at a time and come home empty handed, myself being 11-13 years of age and unable to fend for myself. After some time of rejoining my mother, besides the pain it caused being held by her was the most beautiful feeling I’ve ever had in my life, and I’d suffer those years a million times over to feel her touch again. One day then when I lived with her she didn’t wake up. She had drank so much, and at the age of 40 my mother was dead. I went back to my father and found his relationship with the step mom that wronged me was coming to an end; she had cheated on him. Still my father did not believe me, he did not want to speak of her ever, all my pain was shoved back down my throat. When I turned 15 he met another woman, who was honestly a very very nice lady, but it was too late for a mother to love me, and I treated her poorly as much as I regret it. I started cutting myself, so deep I had to get stitches, I went to therapy and was diagnosed with PTSD and whatever other labels they wanted to imprint on me. When I turned 17 they said I was ok and I believed it. I knew nothing of the world or the pain that was contained deep within me or how it would come to affect my future. One day the hate boiled up and impulsively when I was 17 I told my father to screw himself I packed my things, and looked at his face as he cried and begged me not to go, and I left out that door and never looked back. I had a girl that I had fallen in love with, who I thought was all I needed to get through life. So I went out into the big city by myself(Chicago is my hometown) and I lived through homelessness for many years. The girl I speak of, she stuck with me through it all. The nights I slept on the train or on the street, not being able to keep a job, lost in the world not knowing what to do. I persevered. I didn’t give up. I held a goal in my head of what I wanted and I found the heart in my soul to overcome my struggles. I taught myself programming and economics, how to build computers, design network infrastructures. I started my own company at 21 and I was making nearly $12k/mon and I did it all myself and paid myself. I was so proud of myself. And she made sure I wasn’t alone for a minute of it. I asked her to marry me and she said yes. She went off to school and moved 4 hours away from me and it wasn’t long after that the reality of my dependence on her over the years showed. I ruined my relationship with her because my own doubts and I was filled with loneliness and Insecurities and I destroyed my entire life. My company that I had built up fell to the ground. I fell off the earth in depression, ignoring this beautiful girl who loved me, pushing her away, after about a year of it I lost myself and talked to another woman(did not cheat sexually, but I cheated nonetheless). She was made aware and left me. We spoke again months later but she had moved on to another man. Some time passes and what I thought was the most painful year of my life came to an end. Her and I were finally over and we stopped all talking. I had moved on I thought. I got a job at the stock exchange as an options broker. I had my dream job, I had good insurance, I made GREAT money, I had a 2020 car paid in cash by myself at the age of 22, I had a $10,000 bed set, all numerous of material things that I was proud of having obtained myself. Somehow me and this girl started talking again, she needed somewhere to stay, I was single and missed her, thought maybe it could work again, so I let her move in with me and we started dating again, this is 7 years now on and off with her. She stayed with me for 3 months. She totaled my new car, she lost her job because I wouldn’t let her drive the next one I bought and despised me for it. She didn’t like living where I was where she didn’t know anybody. I started to become depressed and coming home seemed like a chore. Endless nights of screaming and no peace. One night she laid her hands on me and I lost it. I went into the bathroom and cut my throat. I was taken to the hospital and hospitalized. I came back out and decided I wasn’t going back to her and while she experienced the traumatic event that I put her through I never answered her calls once or gave a shit about her. I just started talking to all types of woman, screwing anyone and having different girls in my bed every night. Blowing my money away, pretending to feel secure in the arms of women I hardly knew. After I got tired of random girls, I realized what I had lost and fell into a deep depression. I lost my dream job on top of that because of COVID, now I rot away in my apartment collecting unemployment. I went to see this girl a few nights prior, and while we made love and agreed the connection we felt together was inseparable, she has a new boyfriend and says she knew that cheating on him was wrong, and even though she wishes so badly to have me again that I left her and I shouldn’t have waited all those months to come back to her. So she kissed me a final time, told me she loved me forever, and said our goodbyes. Now, as I mentioned before, I sit here in this lonely apartment, stuck in my head, nobody to talk to, killing myself from the inside, unable to eat or sleep or do anything, as if the evil in me wants me to fall deeper into the abyss. The pain has become so much it’s suffocating, constant crying, unable to breathe, the constant panic. I decided yesterday that I am going to end my life tonight. I have obtained sodium nitrite and plan to take this with a mild sedative and a final note to the woman I still love. I guess the reason I’m reaching out here is because part of me still wants to hope. There’s a still a part somewhere that wants more, I’ve just lost him and I don’t want to take this pain anymore. It is fully my responsibility and choice, however if I cannot find an escape today, then I will choose the only one I see left",At the end of my road,1

Since then my parents took away all of my knives and razors, they then took my phone so I couldn’t talk to anyone. They eventually gave me my phone back and I could only talk to my gf. For awhile it was just me and my gf I rly loved her, and she loved me. Then on October 3 my parents cought me vaping which Ik was dumb but it took my mind off things. Then for a week I couldn’t speak to anyone. Eventually they gave me my things back and I could talk to my friends and gf. Then on November 3rd (not my lucky number ig) my gf dumped me and said I should kill my self, two days later she ghosted me. I didn’t see it coming and for someone I thought loved me so much to just leave made me feel more alone then ever. Today would be our 6 month anniversary and fuck this sucks I hate everything.

171,"My whole life I've had nothing. No hobbies no anything. My parents would buy me a gadget and expect me to have fun with it for the rest of my life. 

When you want a child to get into something you can't just buy them a beginner kit and never buy anything else. You have to get more challenging things. So they stay interested.

But worse than that, their ideas for what they would want me to be when I was older would change and they would buy me some other thing. 

And so I am left as a shell of a person, who knows a little about everything but also nothing about everything. I never have anything to do. All the gadgets stopped working years ago. My parents haven't bought me anything for years.

I don't want to do school anymore. Because what do I have to look forward to when I'm done. Just more nothing. 

I don't want to have model kits anymore, though it would be better if I even had that, which I don't. I want the real things. I want to do something that means something. I've never made anything, it's like I never even existed. If I died today my grave would say ""Here lies nothing"".

I have $11,000 dollars I made from various jobs, but my parents took my debit card. They want me to spend the money on college. But in order to find out what I like, I have to buy things to test if I like them. Why even work.

I've told them all these things, maybe not as flamboyantly as this, they are not easy people to be straight with. But they always just forget what I said dismissing it as me wanting some new device or something and keep watching their shows.

I'm not greedy, I would buy it all myself. Hell buying a jar of peanut butter would give me a sense of freedom I've never had before. I have no control over my money, no control over my life.

173,"I kind of had a messed up childhood. When I was younger I never realized just how bad it was but I was in an environment where my mom and stepfather were always drinking, my stepfather beat my mother in front of me, I watched them steal things like furniture from mobile homes, I watched my stepfather get into multiple fights with other people (at ages as early as 4-5), etc. A combination of that, being bullied in middle and high school, and some of my own behavioral patterns have basically turned me into a socially inept coward. I never felt confident in socializing. Moving around a lot I was always the “weird new kid”. I learned to be as polite as possible and never rock the boat (a combination of my own learned fears and having my *ss beat for not having the utmost manners when I was a kid). 

Because of that I hate confrontation. I’ve spent years training martial arts to help me with my confidence but despite any assurance in my physical ability to defend myself I feel like a worthless human being because I can’t even put in a two week’s notice at work without feeling guilty or having my voice shake. What makes it even more embarrassing is that I’m 6’3, 215 lbs and have the backbone of a 3rd grade girl. Yeah I can blame it on my jacked up childhood but the effects are still there. 

My girlfriend is the only person I have that’s extremely close to me. I can literally FEEL that she isn’t attracted to me anymore. We never have sex anymore, I do her homework for her despite not wanting to simply to not rock the boat. She has me by the balls. I feel like such a loser because even though she’s not working and I am, she has more money than me. Because of that, she’s been paying the rent. I’m barely scraping by but I don’t have anyone to ask for help. I don’t know where to go or what to do, I’ve never been so overwhelmed. I used to be really close with my mom but then because her boyfriend threatened to kill me and I refused to associate with him anymore, my relationship with my mother has gone to shit. She doesn’t care about me anymore. It’s funny she used to call my father a piece of shit for not helping me financially. 

Now she has me run errands for her because I love her. She always says things like “I wish I could help you fix your teeth (which have had cavities that need since my senior year of high school, but I don’t have money, maybe ask your loser dad for some help” right before she drops $800 on some new shoes and $200 on a pen for her boyfriend (yes, ink pen, and yes actually an $800 pair of shoes). 

I can barely even afford my rent because I’m broke. The only reason I even have this apartment is because my dad’s mother co-signed it for me. The only reason I have to live in it is because my mom’s mom didn’t want me living at her house anymore (I was originally supposed to be moved far away for grad school by now).

I didn't even do anything bad just smoked weed and drank a lot the first 2 years. In third year i dried coke and ket and used codeine quite often. I never did anything enough to get addicted.

If you're going to try, go all the way. There is no other feeling like that. You will be alone with the gods, and the nights will flame with fire. You will ride life straight to perfect laughter. It's the only good fight there is.

189,"I try to stay positive, though this year makes it hard. But when I see my friends achieve all of the stuff that I've always dreamed of, it makes me feel worthless. Like one of my friends got a management job in a place that I tried to apply with and another went to get a book published. Part of me is happy for them, but then I look at myself. All I've done lately is just play games and stare at a blank Word document. I've tried to apply to many different jobs, tried out new activities, but with absolutely no luck.

Now I just feel like a waste of space, like I'm just taking up the world's resources and not contributing anything meaningful to it.",I'm just a worthless piece of garbage,1
190,"Well that and my unborn baby that I still feel like giving up for adoption so he could have a decent life. 

I've been depressed for 15 years, wasn't a happy kid before that, either. 

I'm literally hopeless. Life is hopeless. Every day I wish I would have had the guts to kill myself when I was 15. Back then the thought of my dog and grandma being sad stopped me. 

Now it's the feeling of shame. 

I know it's stupid. What do I care what people think, I will be dead, it's not like I'll be around to feel the shame? It's not rational, yet I can't get past that feeling. 

After trying everything during these past 15 years I'm 100% sure I will never be cured and life will never get better. I have no hope. If it wasn't for the shame, I would wait until my child is born, give him away and immediately go kill myself. But now I will be stuck with not just my lifetime of depression but also a kid to take care of. And I already know I'm going to ruin his life because of my depression one way or another. 

Doesn't matter how many times I go see a psychiatrist or how many more years of therapy I'll do. This shit will never get better. 

I fantasize about suicide often. How I'd love to cease to exist. To not feel or think anything. To not exist as a failure anymore. I'd just be a deceased failure. 

Right now I'm just hoping that I can survive another 20-30 years or so and hopefully raise my son to be strong enough to survive if I ""accidentally"" die somehow.

Edit: In addition, when I see people posting about wanting to die, I literally have nothing to say to them. I envy the ones who are strong enough to kill themselves. I wish it was me. When people talk about wanting to kill themselves, even when I feel like they're still young and have their whole life ahead of them, I think ""what if they're like me and it will never get any better? Who am I to tell them to hang in there?""

That's another funny thing about my mind. I don't envy the numerous people who are now happy despite having depression, suicidal thoughts and even suicide attempts in the past. I don't envy them because I don't feel like it's realistic it could ever happen to me. That I could ever be that lucky. My whole life has been a series of shit going wrong. Me flipping the coin for heads, getting tails every time. That ship has sailed for me, so the only realistic dream for me is to just die and not feel anymore.",Shame is the only thing keeping me alive,1

He keeps saying how ""no one will ever understand what he's going through"" and how ill never know him, and I want to tell him I was in the same position he is a few years ago where I used to self harm all the time. I want to tell him that ""look i DO understand what you're going through cuz i used to self harm almost everyday for a few years so you can tell me anything and I will not judge you, ever!"" But im also afraid he may hear that and think self harm is an attractive option for him at the moment and rather than open up to me, he may begin self harming - which would be the exact opposite of what my intentions are.

Tldr; I want to open up to him and tell him he's not alone in his issues and that he can ALWAYS open up to me with 0 judgement, but im also afraid that telling him about my self harm past would influence him to take that sort of action now so I'm super conflicted. 

Any advice is appreciated!

Ps: I do still self harm but im going to tell him I dont and that its been years since I've done it. I've, for the most part, have been able to control it really well and my coping mechanisms do work but ofc sometimes it jumps out.",Should I tell depressed brother I used to self harm?,1

204,"To start off this year I got accused at work for something I didn't do, tried to fight it but my supervisor only accepted her pov and not mine. I had a temporary fulltime contract and the month before they gave me a 3 months contract (who the f gives a 3 months contract?) so I had 2 months left. I didn't expect a new contract because of what happened and I didn't even want a new contract at the company. She also laughed at my face when I asked if I could promote into a different role (with no money increase) saying ""other people deserve it, you don't"". This was my first real job after college. The same month after being accused I found a new job and wanted the old job to end on a good note, of course, that didn't happen. She wanted me to stay for another month before she could find a new employee, with my stupid brain I said yes. 2 weeks of depression pass by and everyone notices I stopped caring about what is going on at work. She then fired me 2 weeks earlier and said ""You're not making my team any better"" well of course I don't make 'your' team any better because you're the one that's ruining it. 

6 months go by at the new company and I'm getting more depressed again, it's the same repetitive job everyday, same actions, same routine. I hated it because it gave my brain too much room to think about what happened at my previous job. The colleagues were amazing which was the reason I was staying, but I'm glad I left. 

For 4 months I've been working at a new company, I kind of enjoy the work. Now that I look back on my first job I realized it still left a ton of trauma and every time I have to go talk to my supervisor about how it's going I feel the urge to run away because I think it'll happen all over again.

I can’t go on anymore (please be aware of trigger warning)

I’m so depressed. I don’t know what to do. Please someone just listen to me for once. 

I’m 24 years old and a female. I have a lovely little boy who is 7 months old and a husband who I have been with for 5 years nearly. I am also 4 months pregnant with our second boy. 
I weigh around 190 pounds so I’m not too slim unfortunately. 

From around 11 I’ve had a history of health anxiety. I cannot post on health anxiety as you are usually blocked from posting about suicide over there. Maybe I will be here too but I’m giving it a shot. 

After my son was born, maybe when he was around 2 months old, I began experiencing health issues nobody could explain. This was back in June. I had weird mid back pain that has never gone away, acid reflux, stomach pains that would travel to my back too on the left hand side. At the end of August, I finally got an ultrasound scan and the doctor said there was nothing to note. I told him I was terrified as my grandpa died of something called pancreatic cancer and I have all the symptoms. He brushed me off and said my blood tests didn’t indicate an issue with my liver or pancreas so I was offered no further help. I last had blood tests taken in August. 
In October I had basic bloods done by my midwife (not to check liver function or anything like that) just full blood count and my blood sugar levels. The blood sugar levels showed I was borderline diabetic. This was put down to pregnancy but at the time I was only 7 weeks pregnant so surely not. It inflated my pancreatic cancer fears. 

I am still in pain now. Every day I live in absolute horror and fear. I’m convinced I’m turning yellow (jaundice) like my grandpa did, despite the fact nobody else can see it. My back always hurts no matter what massages I get or what exercises I do and I know my second pregnancy has not caused this on account I had these issues before. 

I just don’t feel good at all. I don’t feel very well. Tonight I am at an all time low. 

My husband has gone to bed as he is unwell with the flu, I’ve put my son down to sleep for the night and I’m now sitting in our home office just sobbing. I can’t go on this way. Nobody will help me. I can’t see a therapist as I live in a country where there is a 18 week wait at the moment for therapy and I can’t afford to pay privately. I can’t ask my doctor to refer me for additional testing as he just won’t. They are not taking me seriously. Nobody is. 

I feel like I’m going to die in a few weeks or a few months and be taken away from my son and my family. I’ve tried so hard to get medical professionals to listen but they don’t care. The only test I’ve had is an ultrasound and often ultrasound don’t pick up on pancreatic issues anyway. 

I don’t want to die this young but I know I am going to. I want to kill myself so that I can go out on my own terms and not on any illnesses terms. I’m absolutely sobbing and so fed up. I don’t know what to do. I’m sick of checking my abdomen for lumps. I’m sick of waiting to develop jaundice. Im sick of checking my pee and poop constantly to see if my pee is orange as I was told again, this is a sign of jaundice and cancer.

I got sober 6 years ago in AA and within a few months I was pretty happy. The last few years I've been dealing with a lot of chronic pain issues. Even through all that, I remained pretty happy, other than having anger issues. About a year ago, I started smoking pot and did so for months without any issues. By the time the summer rolled around I was the happiest I'd been in years. I felt very fulfilled and I was really enjoying my little family. Then in July, a few weeks after having an epidural steroid injection, I developed severe pain in my back, buttocks and leg. I started taking gabapentin 3x per day and subsequently started having a lot of mental side effects. I became depressed, anxious and somewhat manic. I tried to come off the medication and ended up in severe withdrawal. Had to go back on it and taper off slowly. I've been off of it for over 2 months but I'm still dealing with depression and anxiety. I have been coming apart at the seems. I've been using drugs again to cope with the pain and self-medicate. I know I'm making things worse, but I don't know what to do. I'm scared of medications now, but I'm totally losing my ability to function. I thought I was so strong and now I feel like I can't even make decisions for myself. I cry everyday, multiple times per day. I think about suicide regularly,  but then I get more upset because I couldn't fathom leaving my wife and son behind. In addition to this, I'm dealing with chronic pain everyday.

233,"I(18M) suffer from bouts of depression. I don't let it effect my personal and academic pursuits but it has become increasingly overbearing for a great time now. I think that I suffered from this for the past 3 years (sophomore, junior, senior year) and simply just worked through it. It doesn't have much to do with academic performance ( I got one of the 5 colleges I was aiming for) and neither does it have much to do with familial relationships (although I have a horrible habit of holding grudges). I am a very social creature as well, so no worries on that front. Whenever there's such an episode, I am usually alone. There's also the feeling of shame that occurs during this time. Although these episodes occur almost monthly, I am able to function rather well in society but I can feel my mental state deteriorating.

I can't take a walk (parents have been treating Covid patients since March and I am a huge risk) and I don't miss my meals or stay dehydrated.

236,"This is my first post on here. I never tried it before because I feel like talking about my problems doesn't really solve anything. I've dealt with depression since I was 13 and now at 28, I feel like it's gotten so bad. My parents are very old school and believe that if I just eat the right foods and ""get out a little"" that my depression will just automatically go away. The source of my depression comes from the feeling of feeling like my life will never amount to anything and of course, the worst of it all, money. I've always struggled with money, while my family was thriving in it. I've had to work at a young age just to get by. I have medical issues that make it really hard to hold a job, because employers don't seem to understand. Tried to get disability but never worked out. This year has been the toughest. I lost my job to covid and have been severely struggling ever since. Unemployed only got so far until it ran out. I live with roommates that are my ""friends"" but treat me more like a stranger, giving me rules while when I try to give them some rules (since we are all on the lease and pay rent) they always fight me on it. I feel like a prisoner in my own place. To make matters worse, my cat, the love of my life, my baby boy, the only thing that has helped me stay alive during this dark time, has been sick and with no job or money, desperately trying to find resources, it's hard to get him the care he needs. Rent is coming up, bills are coming up and all of this is so stressful and depressing to me to the point where I feel like I could be happier just ending my life. I know it may seem like little things I'm complaining about but I'm just tired of things not working out. I apply for jobs, I do the best I can to try to just get by and nothing is good enough. My family wont help me, even though they can and it just makes me mad. Why have me in the first place. I don't want to deal with it. I just want to escape. I want to cop out, kick the bucket, end it. I'm not religious but I've even prayed. Prayed for an angel to just save me from this all. I don't know what to do. I don't know where to go.",Sometimes I feel like things would be better off If I wasn't alive,1
237,"this is my first time ever posting here. 

I was diagnosed with depression at a young age after my parent's divorce. But that is a whole other story, may. When COVID hit, I was student teaching, so I did not really feel the effects of being such at home all day. Around August, though, I think a higher power really just said go screw yourself because it has been a tough and emotional fall season for me. 

To start, I moved four hours away from home to go to Grad School to be with my boyfriend, who I don't even know if he is my boyfriend. We have been together for four years now, and they have been an amazing four years and super hard. His parents, well, they don't like me because I am white. In fact, they have never met me and refuse to do so. Then recently, I found out they are forcing him to stay home next semester because, well, they pay for his schooling, and I know he tried to fight them; I know he did. But in the end ... I still feel stupid? I guess. Like, when will I be the first pick? 

And really, that's the icing on the cake. My shit journey started when my five-year-old half brother told me that our beloved father beats him with a belt until his butt bleeds. No one could confirm this, and my aunt, who is a social worker and shares a house with them, did talk to my brother, and she said that he did not know what she was talking about. But I know. I know what that man can do. When I was in first grade, I went to my dad's for the weekend and forgot my backpack. He punished me by making me clean the bathroom floor with a toothbrush. So that was a great moment in my life ... I cried about that for weeks. Felt horrible for never seeing them, never being there for him. I felt useless. 

AND the real kicker to the groin is that I live with a crazy roommate and another roommate who is always shoved so far up my ass that I now kind of hate her? Which makes moving 4 hrs away even worse. My crazy roommate hides my things to make me feel crazy. She comes home and screams at me for shit I didn't do. I just feel empty, exhausted, and lost. I don't know what I expect to get out of this post. I guess I just needed to put it out to the world, so thank you to anyone who genuinely reads it. And for those concerned, I do have a therapist we do talk often.",Hi,1
238,"Basically I thought things would work out for me. HA. 

I got a well paying job cleaning so left my job in retail. and to put it simply I was shit at it. I knew I would be fired so I quit. I apparently had complaints about my cleaning - and I knew they came from the brown-nosing stuck up cow I worked with a couple of days a week - and I knew that when I knew I was being watched constantly I would just get worse. It’s the way my brain works. I try to do good but just get worse. So I quit. I just couldn’t face another day with that bitch.

And this is how it’s gone so far: 

I applied to a job and was naive enough to think I’d get it. Screwed up the Zoom call. Wasn’t prepared because the interview was dropped on me last minute. Haven’t heard anything so that’s that ...

Now I have nothing. I left my last job in search of better things and ended up being told I couldn’t even scrub the crap off strangers toilets properly. 

I decided call my mum. I said “I screwed up”. She said “heh”. SHE LAUGHED.

So I decided to go on a walk at 1am with my dog. I was drunk. I nearly broke my ankle, and walked with uncomfortable boots and no socks. By the end of my 2 hour walk my foot was covered in blood. Now I’m in pain because I have a massive split blister on one foot. I was sat there at 3am washing the blood off my foot and patching up my other blistered foot.

And I’m just fucking lost. 

I also did my brother a favour and took him shopping after work. He forgot his card so I bought his stuff for him and he promised he’d pay me back. I’m £40 down because he hasn’t. It’s been a week and I keep asking. I did him a favour ... even went out and bought extra for him when he thought he had the virus so isolated. Nothing. I got nothing back

I’m done. I have no money. No job. I’m at rock bottom. 6 years of university for this ... I’m such a fucking disappointment and I hate myself more than words can say. 

I kind of want to go on another long walk. And not come back. I live alone. No one calls me or visits. Nobody will know til they want a fucking favour and I’m not there. Screw this",I screwed up big time. Now I’m out of work during a pandemic 😭,1
239,"I've been suffering from depression and anxiety all my life. There were a few times where I was close to doing something bad but i somehow managed to get out of that hole somehow. 

For a while now I felt unable to get out of that hole. Days where I feel ""ok"" have been getting less and less. 

On the rare good days I can talk to people and be funny and love myself. 

On bad days I feel like everyone hates me, like I don't deserve to live, like I'm only there to make other people happy. I'm getting panic attacks from the tiniest of problems. I feel like jumping off a bridge all the time. I awake in the middle of the night unable to sleep. In other words, it's bad. 

Still for most of my life I thought I was normal. Sometimes i still doubt that I have depression and anxiety. But if this were normal, I wonder why people smile and are genuinely happy with everything. 

I never liked showing this side of myself cause I feel it makes me weak. But i feel relieved and strong to be finally able to talk about it and to have told my therapist.

240,"I dreamt about going to college. Early on in my high school career, my guidance counselor had told me that it would be impossible for someone like me to go to college. She told me that if I had even attempted to apply to a university it would be pointless.

I took her advice, and so I never put in an application for any colleges. This proved to be a mistake, as the people around me who’s academia were nowhere near as good as my own were accepted to multiple college, and even my best friend who didn’t care about school until I became his tutor in junior year for acceptances to 3 different colleges, 1 of which was MY dream school.

Now I’m a freshman at a junior college, and I’m still dreaming of going to a UC. I have isolated myself from friends and family and punish myself harshly in order to excel in my academics and have the chance of getting into a UC.

I had a phone call with a counselor from my college, and it turns out that it’s impossible for me to be able to get into a UC, as my major is only transferable to a CSU. 

I grew up in squalor to an abusive family, and from my childhood was relentlessly bullied and assaulted by those around me. I had struggled with suicidal behavior and ideation for most of my life, but tried to stay alive all for my dream of getting into a UC and having a career I loved, and from there being able to finally find someone who loves me. 

Now that possibility is gone. The one thing that kept me from killing myself was a dream, and that dream got ripped up right in front of my face.

I know that I shouldn’t feel like the world owes me something, but it makes no sense that I was born into a world of hate and torment, only to be badly beaten and abused every waking moment of my existence all for nothing at all.

&amp;#x200B;

 Okay so I was in bed 2 a.m can't sleep for shiit. Had nothing to do so I just started the daily routine of questioning my existence haha.  I thought about my past from being a child to an adult, my miserable stupid moments, how my parents treated me and...though I never felt bad for not having any friends. It still hits me like a hella comet. Yeah I never had a person I could call as a friend. Still pretty reasonable tho for a person who don't like speaking and always turn down people's friendly invitation because I'm afraid of spending my time alone in a crowd. Well then my heart starts to souring my lungs start to clutching like it's taking a last breath. I'm going to cry. Like a fucking schoolgirl refering to my parents word. But I can't cry in a normal way. Because I‘m very good at retreating my marching tears' army.  Have your parents ever order you to STOP CRYYING NOW! I had that ability because of that. But I still need to cry sometime. So I found out a way...strong physical pain can trigger all my tears I been holding back. Okay I know this sounds like a teenage girl faking stories to get attention but...it really works for me. I'm not gonna use a knife tho. I...use both my fist to punch myself in the head. And ummm scratching my face like I'm using my fingernails to crave an artistic statue but instead of a real statue all I created was an ugly miserable meat.  Also hurt some other body parts main involved my hands. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here comes the strangest part. As I'm trying to get myself into the mood of my ""stupid faggot crying mode"". My mind suddenly...scattered into pieces by a rushing flood of many many thoughts and emotions. And...I just can't collect myself back to one piece. It's very hard to describe...but I was surely losing control of myself. My mind kinda started to do multiple task at once. I was squishing my fat face hard like I always hoping to do to the neighbor's golden retriever puppy. I was laughing silently like those crazy ppl in horror movies. Oh I was 'craving' my face when laughing so...it's kind of unsettling. What's more unsettling is...I truely felt happy deep in my heart for doing that. As my body crazily 'twtching' my mind went to another place. I was thinking a post I saw on this sub. The op said she realized nobody ""really"" wants to deal with a depressed person and I deeply agreed with her. I spent 2 hours typed so much nonsense in my horrible engrish then I decided to delete it all. Nobody wants to deal with a negative toxic person. Then I thought about the bison man Diane married with in Bojack the horsemen. His his son told Diane that his dad just love women with mental problems. And I thought if there's really some people like him willing to love a depressed person. And then I thought about my identity as a gay man and what I'm lacking compared to Diane. I can't have children to repay the man who loves me. I don't have a nice voice like Diane. I don't speak fluent English. I can't do social things with other people. I can fall into full breakdown just because I speak too much.

Welp...shouldn't have started the meaningless rambling. So as I said...I'm stepping into a new level of being depressed. I feels like an evolving Pokemon when saying this lol.

One was supervising the other two like an emotionless god. One was gone total berserk and started a toxic hurricane in my brain making me hate everything like  **Illidan Stormrage** ’s ten thousands years hatrey. Then there was me.

244,"I know for a fact that I have had depression for about 6 years now. Although not medically diagnosed it does not take a genius to work out if you are feeling the symptoms or not. I'm stuck at a sort of mental crossroads right now and really don't know what to do with myself. 

I'm a 19 year old male from the UK and have felt the impact of depression from when I was about 13 years old. I remember exactly what triggered and caused it and really the exact moment it all happened. Over the span of these 6 years or so I have felt myself becoming more and more detached from my life and becoming more and more careless about myself and others for that matter. I spent almost my entire teenagerhood locked inside of my bedroom doing absolutely nothing at all because I just did not care or enjoy anything enough to want to go out and do something. Thinking back on all of the ""fun"" I missed out on is what makes me honestly the most sad. 

I recently just finished all of my education, passed college with really good grades but cheated and don't know what to do. I need to get a job, my parents have been going on and on at me to get one and I get it, I understand I need one but I just don't care enough about myself to get one. You only get a job to earn money and you earn money to live, if you do not care about living why would you get one right? and that's where I come with the question, What should I do? 

I have heard from other people on other forums around my age who say that once you become an adult you are taken as a joke and no one wants to help you and that you should just ""grow up"". I would go to the doctors or someone like that to get help but again I have no fucking care in the world for it, and honestly from what I've heard would be a waste of time as well.  I did try to tell my parents when I was younger and they did not believe me and would honestly feel too embarrassed to tell them now that I'm an adult. 

Although never truly tried, I've been in the suicidal state of mind for a few years, were to me it does not matter if I live or die. However with all of the stress going on at the moment I have kind of awakened to the fact that suicide is actually a viable option to escape the things that I am feeling, Everyday I feel like I'm getting closer and closer to the breaking point and one day might snap and just go along with it. I'm not sure if I would have the courage to do it though, which I guess makes it worse. 

As I said before, I honestly don't know what to do with myself, I feel like I've buried myself into a hole so deep that there's really no way out. Along with the other stuff like not being able to focus and not being able to think straight anymore I actually feel helpless and have actually decided to open up over the internet, I guess desperate times call for desperate measures.

246,"I have tried almost everything but nothing seems to fill the void that I feel, and have been feeling since I was a child probably. 
Now I'm 20, and I am convinced that the problem lies within myself, I am not a clairvoyant but I can't see happiness in my future, not because life is necessarily sad, but because I'm incapable of being happy;
I have no hope in relationships, romantic or not, everything becomes faulty and rot after a while, so that can't be something to hold on to;
I have no religious belief and I'll never have one because none of them makes sense, so I don't even have that comfort (because a belief is a comfort, makes life a lot easier), I'm just so aware of the intrinsic lack of purpose of everything, I don't know if I'm making sense as I'm pretty tired right now and just wanted to rant, but yeah life is so absurd, people go around thinking they have purpose just because they think they have, or they find purpose in the lack of purpose itself. 
This might sound insane but I have this Idea that humanity is schizophrenic, living in an imaginary world full of meanings and symbols we came up with.... 

Being born means being born in a society with it's symbols and meanings,  some people just accept them growing up and live a ""happy"" Life, while others do not and become outcasts in a way or another (I am more of an outcast inside my own mind for example, not a literal one, I know a lot of people and have friends but I'm still an outcast as I can't fit in capitalist society). 

I'm getting a little off topic, sorry, the fact is that I don't know what to try anymore, I did a bit of mindfulness but it didn't help me, right now I'm nothing and a lot of things at the same time... A musician, philosopher, a nothing... Someone who just quit smoking, an idealist but cynical, with a positive attitude but negative to the core... You get what I mean? 
And some people even think I am cool... I'm not cool motherfuckers I am insane, don't pick me as a role model please or you'll end up as unhappy as me is what I'd want to tell them, so yeah that probably says a lot about the perception I have of myself hahaha

And I know that I'm probably too harsh on myself, that I am a nice person to be with and that while I'm certainly not the best I'm not the worst either, but knowing it doesn't help, I have no particular problem causing my pain and that only makes it worse. 

So is life worth living? I personally don't know, but since the only way of knowing the answer is living I guess I'll keep on doing that for a while, I'm not asking for help, I doubt you could help me I'm too deep in this shit, just wanted to try another thing and vent off a little...

But that was the good side of my life. My parents split up when I was 4 so i mainly lived with my mom, having these aforementioned issues there. Then was time at my dad's place.

But now, after some interrogation of family members and digging through memories, it's obvious i was fucking molested and my dad waited over 3 years with moving away from the toxic part of my family, for entirely different reasons too btw. so em, I'm trying to make sense of some wonderful childhood memories here, so any comments?",I was probably molested age 7 and I can't get the thought outta my head,1

I had my 8th and final session this morning. It was oddly satisfying, I said thanks to my therapist and we redid a questionnaire from the start to show my progress. I am better than I was two months ago... the intrusive thoughts are very infrequent now,  I’m dwelling less and less on the “trauma” that cause all this, I haven’t had any emotional breakdowns or sobbing episodes in the past two weeks. But I’m still not happy...

I still don’t find any enjoyment in my old hobbies anymore, I dread the thought of going out and drinking with friends, the only thing that doesn’t fill me with fear and sadness is sitting in bed and binging Netflix... which brings in loneliness and makes me feel worse eventually. 

My college also provides 8 free therapy sessions... but I dunno if I have the strength to go through it again. It’s such a mental drain...

265," I've been going to a psychologist for over an year because I lost joy, excitement, and motivation to do the things I liked doing. I've talked to her a while ago and suggested me to go see a psychiatrist because I wasn't making any progress. I feel stucked no matter how hard I try to do things better, I'm studying philosophy and piano and I have those responsabilities to care of, but im just not engaged, like if I had this things that weight me down every day. I make an effort to wake up, not because I want to, just because.. I'm like this train that has lost communication to every near city and doesn't knows where's he's going. I just stand there by inertia, trying to control the damn thing, trying to avoid to ask myself WHY because I know there are no satisfying answers.

Everything I do is because I know not doing anything is worse, but I can't help to feel stucked with this pain in my chest. I'm an overthinker. I've been in really dark and confusing places in my head. now I'm kinda over that and can control it better but there's this idea in my head that keeps popping up, that I'm not really depressed and to catalogue myself to that is silly, that I'm just a normal being and I'm experiencing life as it is (I'm 19, so you could say I'm entering the adult life), and that there's a lot of people who feel the same. 

The worst idea that a part of my mind keeps telling me is that I'm exaggerating, and I'm just lazy, and that I know deep down myself how to get out of this numbness but I'm too complicated stupid to even know what is it I have to change. 

I can't say I have lack of effort to be better, but that's all I have. Effort thru the day and months, but never any kind of joy or motivation to do something, even music, that was something I've loved. I'm just very confused and don't know how to move on.

I also been struggling for so long with this that I can no longer remember what's the ""normal state of mind and feeling""; can meds really give some sort of answers to these worries? what if it does nothing and I'm exposed to the reality that there's nothing wrong with me?

266,"A couple of years ago when I would seriously consider suicide I'd feel surges of adrenaline and think to myself that I'd gone crazy for even considering it. Nowadays I feel this incorporeal force pushing me ever closer to do it, and for real this time. Because now whenever I think of suicide and I see myself going through with it I feel at peace, as if my soul is longing for it. My nervous adrenaline has been exchanged for excitement, like a kid a month away from Christmas anxiously waiting.

Have I been desensitized to the thought of it, or perhaps have I come to fully realize the serenity that comes with the end of my life, and have I gained the confidence to end it? Either way it makes me happy, because I've now the strength to end it, and I've already a plan to make it happen.

Am I a bad person for getting upset with those who insist on instilling false hope into me? I've already come to a conclusion after many years of contemplation and introspection leading me to fully believe that suicide is a much better option than clinging to life. Some people are just condemned to live a life of melancholy without remedy, there is no hope for me. Don't tell me otherwise because it really just comes of as invalidation of my life long experience, and it's upsetting.

So, every morning I wake up in a great mood. I absolutely love mornings, first shift, coffee, driving to work listening to music. All of it. I wake up earlier just to have more morning time. But, as soon as I get to my area at work I am slapped in the face with depression. I hold back tears every time I start to speak for the first couple hours. As the day goes on it turns me into this weird zombie like, autopilot robot. And by the time I leave I have no desire to do ANYTHING. Every morning I make a list of things to try to accomplish for the day, and by the time I get home I just want to eat and sleep.

276,"As a kid I was horrible in class because of my hfasd and many teachers told both my mother and I that I would never go to college because of my grades. Fast forward to Senior year of high school where I sign to play for one of the top lacrosse schools in the USA on a full athletic scholarship. I'm the second person in my entire family to ascend so high athletically so naturally I become a central focus of clan M (no pressure at all). After senior year ended I ship off to a new state with hope in my mind and my head up my ass. &gt;&gt; With all the excitement I neglect to look at the very very fine print that screws me over. You see I was told that I would be attending a  ""...newly emerging and eminently respectable engineering program..."". My scholarship was for a liberal arts degree in engineering science... Or the equivalent of a Chuckie cheese fun degree in toy making. So, two months into what was supposed to be the best and most free four years of my life, I drop out and slink back home two states away.  
So I'm back home and swirling down the black drain of depression as a fresh college dropout when my beautiful, radiant, complete psychotic c*nt of a gf dropped out of pre-med to be with me... Yey. We finally get politely but firmly evicted from my mom's house. We move in together which was 7 months of my actual worst nightmare where I give up on my dreams and live in a poverty apartment while working jobs I HATE. I installed gutters, built decks, sold tools at Sears(Rip), sold clothes in department stores, hell I was selling plasma at a point.  
 I eventually got the guts to leave my abusive gf and go back to live with my mom. Right then was when I was hired at the job that most likely saved my life: delivering tacos. Understand at this point I'm at the dangerous part of depression where I openly make suicide jokes in front of anyone. I hated myself for being so near-sighted that I screwed my college and athletic career up. The staff at this mexican restaurant just instantly becomes family from day one, it was like I've been away and they've been waiting for me to come home. They took in broken me, fed me chimichangas and weed, and helped me put the pieces back together. I still can never express to the people that I worked with how much they helped me through the hardest part of my life. I worked there for a little over a year until I received a reply from an application I sent to a research and development company. They company says they would love for me to start working immediately as a technician! I gave a month's notice to my current boss of course because he was and still is awesome.   
Then starts my glamorous career as a technician for a R&amp;D company... A facility technician... For those of you (like me) that don't read fine print that means janitor. So I grind away for a year being the best damn janitor possible until finally I was promoted to research technician. As a research technician I was basically a henchman with better health benefits, I did everything for the researchers I worked with, from being a guinea pig in experiments to getting the Professor's tires fixed. Where I really shine though is fabrication, just give me the part sheets and the assembly drawing and go away. This quickly gains me recognition and an adjustment to the main fabricator for my team.   
It's now four years at this company and I have been recently promoted to Junior Machinist with a full engineering scholarship for work excellence... And still the black drain is there. I have no debt, a great job, about to buy a house, achievements that multiple people combined don't have, and still... The black door opens every now and again.  
  I get so zoned in on one thing, the feeling of playing my favorite sport, I didn't care about the scholarship or the education or even being the best. I just wanted to give it my all. I love that game so much I once entered a tournament on two different teams just so I could play 5-6 games in a day. It's been six years since my last lacrosse game. Now I've been out of it so long I'd be lucky to run a mile without blacking out. I've broken almost every finger twice, shattered two cups, micro-fractured my wrist, broken four teeth, and have permanent tissue damage in my arm and knee from playing lacrosse, and I'd let it happen again if I could.

Option B - Say nothing at all 

Option C - Say something mean (what they did) 


Not only did they choose to say something mean, but they choose not to even mention the insult the where referring to. (This would mentally ruin/fuck up ANYONE! not just me)

Despite only recently getting out of a depressive state, I’m falling into another one. I don’t know what’s causing it this time, and I don’t want people around me to worry.

I’ve hastily made a suicide note a few weeks ago. I’ve been thinking about it a lot more recently. I don’t know why I’m being like this or how to stop.

I am a good friend and a good girlfriend and a good student and a good daughter.

And still, everything dissatisfies me. I think I can't be around people anymore. I am toxic to them because who wants to stay with someone who is an illusion? I'm only an image, an idea in the mind of people I know. I don't really exist for myself.

Last year I was with everything ready to move with my fiancée to a brand new appartment. All new furniture in a new building. Everything seemed to be ok. In june she decided to dump me for her boss, a man who is the exact opposit person of the values I always had in my life: history of drug abuse, wife-beating, in his mid 40's (15 years older than us) and who is involved in dirty politics. Well, for me only the damage and the mortgage were left. I had to move to my parent's (yes, really with 32 years) and rent the appartment so I could afford my living. Have developed a huge depression, the reason I'm taking medicines for a year and two months by now.And after all this time things that happen to her still have impact on me. Recently her husband got elected as an alderman, which is kind of a big deal status-wise where I live, and that bumped me so hard I felt like the day we broke up again. That made me feel like I was a burden in her life, because she has such a good life right now.Currently I am stalled in my so called career and I don't have a clue how to nor the energy to improve. Also where I live cars are very expensive goods, and as I had sold mine to buy the things for the new place, 1 year and 3 months later I didn't manage to buy another one. My expenses with health (therapist, psychiatrist, medicines) are draining my resources and sometimes I feel like I'm not even improving emotionally.

.

I lost 100 pounds and completely changed my diet..

.

I did cardio and strength training atleast 5 days a week, often 7.

.

I grew my social confidence, made myself the aggressor of eye contact, made myelf the key to conversations with my friends.

.

I got my first job and I was always on time, never gave up, never fussed, always did what was wanted from me.

.

Acted selflessly, would do things for others expecting nothing in return, would always help people if I could, would collaborate where before I'd stay my own path.

.

Pursued new skills that I always dreamed of, ready for failure but stubbornly insisting on success.

.

And where have I gotten after all of this?

.

My weight fluctuates randomly, sometimes I eat nothing for days taking immense effort, and I end up gaining weight. It is clear that I have no control anymore and cannot reach my goal, it would be superhuman, I must have cursed genetics

.

As a result I have no drive to exercise, it's pointless suffering for an unreachable goal.

.

I lost all my friends, my own decision. Played dead for weeks and got about 2 messages about it and they didn't seem too concerned. So all that social improvement was completely pointless.

.

Lost my job in 3 months. Had great coworkers but the management were absurd, when I go back there every single person I recognized is gone. Effort squandered, treated like dirt and belittled.

.

All my selfless actions were for not because no one actually cared about me, they saw a tool. My own parents lied to me, saying I could clean out their horded garage for my entrepreneurial projects. I cleaned it all out, threw away things I really cared about, only for it to be revealed that they were ready to immediately shove more of their shit back in it and merely used me for the free labor and weren't concerned at all with the immorality of their actions.

.

All the skills I've learned have come to a screeching halt. As the programming tech needed for my goals gets more and more obtuse and help is scarcer and scarcer, I have pretty much been left entirely stranded against an impenetrable wall.

.

So I've put in tremendous effort to improve and all for nothing. I have lost everything, my friends, my family, my prospects, my passions, I have nothing left. I still try to reach out, no one cares. No one will read this even. Somehow it's always my fault, somehow everyone whos taken and taken and taken from me my whole life will find a way to blame me for not giving a little more as no one has given me anything. I've never touched a girls hand, I haven't even touched someone else period in probably 6 years. I reach out and am ignored, even in mental health help discords its as if I'm blocked on arrival because it's like I'm not there. No one cares, no amount of self improvement will change that. I wish I weren't here. 

.

I did realize that I could take the weights I used to try and be better and tie them around my neck and plunge into the pool. The irony of it is amusing, about the only stimulating feeling that wasn't immense hate anger or sadness in weeks.","The ""self improvement"" lie",1

Some background information before you read my situation:

I am 17, A senior in highschool, the girl is 16, a junior in highschool

I wrote my situation entirely:

&amp;#x200B;

I met this girl online about seven months ago on Snapchat, unfortunately, she lives two hours from me. We texted every day all day long and this was way different than my past relationship. Everything about this girl was so positive and she is amazing. I can tell she really loved me even though we haven't physically met. I have been begging my mom to go on vacation to where she lives. (She lives in Santa Barbra, I live in LA). Today was the big weekend where my mom booked a hotel in Santa Barbra. I was filled with thrill and excitement to finally meet her. We met on Friday evening and she ran up and gave me a huge hug. Our moms met and it went well. Then we went walked downtown to go eat. It was alright but the conversation wasn't very flowy. It was awkward at moments. I walked her to her car and she drove me back to my hotel. I was kind of upset. We texted afterward and it was a little awkward as well and I told her it will be better tomorrow when we hang. (My vacation in Santa Barbra was for three days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday). But I ended the conversation with ""goodnight"" and she said ""goodnight"" back. Every day leading up until that day we always said ""goodnight I love you"". Something didn't feel right. We met up the next day and went to an aquarium. It was still kinda awkward. After that, we went downtown and walked around for a bit. We got Starbucks and sat down. There was nothing to do and she kept asking me what I wanted to do. I said I don't feel like walking around right now. She said so what do you want to do? I kept saying I don't know. Eventually, I had the guts to say ""can we go somewhere private"" and she said sure but where. And I said what about your car and she said okay. Before we met up she told me she was on her period and I understood that. I wanted to just kiss her somewhere private where people wouldn't look at us. I didn't want anything more. As we are walking to the car I glance at her and she's texting her friend fastly. When we got to the car her friend called her and said ""I got into a car crash come pick me up"". And she told me sorry I have to go pick up my friend its an emergency let me drop you off at your hotel. I said no it's okay and I got out of the car and walked to my hotel. As I am walking I realized that it was a fake call and she probably didn't want to be in private with me or something. She texted me ten minutes later and said I'm so fucking sorry and I said its ok and she said I can't make it to dinner tonight because I have to watch my sister. And I said ok and she left me on read. We were supposed to meet up later for dinner with my mom. But she left me on read and I felt a weird feeling like I was sad and mad. I deactivated my snapchat and Instagram. I was hoping she would text me on Imessage and ask me what was going on with me. But she didn't. We didn't hang the last day because she didn't text me and I didn't text her. I decided to text her as I was going home in the car. I said we're incompatible and we probably shouldn't talk. I didn't mean this I said It out of anger and I wanted a reaction out of her. But she said she agreed. Then I proceeded to ask her this: there was no car crash right? She left me on read. I was devastated that she lied to me. A couple hours later I sent her a long message basically saying that I love her a lot and even though there was many awkward moments, I enjoyed spending time with her and meeting her and these even months have been amazing. I told her I love her and hopefully we can move forward from this. She responded and said she thought I was really sweet and nice and these past seven months have been crazy fun but she said the distance isn't going to work. She said if I lived there it would be different and we could get to know each other better. I responded saying that I can take the train to her and I might go to college near where she lives. I was trying to show her some solutions. And she hasn't responded. It's been two days since I sent that text. I have been crying non stop and I can't sleep and I have been forcing myself to eat so my mom doesn't get worried but I don't feel like eating. I feel like there is no point in life now. The thing that makes me happy is gone. Life feels grey now. I want to end it.

I feel lonely with no point to live. I don't want to live if it's without her. When we began talking she cured the depression I was going through.

352,"Im a 25 year old male. I enjoy making music and art, and hanging out with friends and spoiling my girlfriend. She deserves it, she had a hard upbringing.

So in January I was working at my old job at a grocery store. I liked my job and all my coworkers were great plus I worked with my younger brother and we always had a blast. My manager used the speaker system to call me to the office which is something they do regularly when they want to tell you something. I dropped what I was working on and headed to the office. When I got there i saw two official looking guys. One holding a leather bound notepad thing. They asked me if they could ask me some questions and I realized they were investigators. I asked what it was about and they asked me if I knew a certain family. I said no because i didnt remember their last name. They kept asking me questions about the family and then I remembered that I did know them. My ex had been close with the family and considered them her uncle/cousins. I asked what it was all about and they still wouldn't tell me. I said that if they wouldn't tell me that I wouldn't answer any more questions. At that point he told me to put my hands behind my back and proceeded to handcuff me. I asked him what for and I was shaking and afraid but I let him cuff me. He said sexual assault of a minor and i said who? And he said the name of my exes 'cousin'.

I had stayed at these people's house, in the basement with my ex for two nights. My ex had invited me over there while she stayed there. I had spoken to the girl who was 11 at the time only a couple times. I barely knew her. But she always seemed a little too friendly and made me slightly uncomfortable. She had also randomly come up to me and told me some guy threatened to rape her and I was like oh.... I didnt know what to say to that.
Now her dad is a gun-nut ultra patriot, which is fine I guess but he also sells drugs for sexual favors to women around town. I saw weed and pills in his house and I was told about the sexual favors. So hes a shady dude. A big loud guy who goes to church but also sells drugs. So that's the kind of family they are.

Anyway. Skip back to the grocery store. I start freaking out and asking them for proof, but they just tell me to not resist arrest. They take me out of my work in handcuffs and there are three police SUVs out front and like 6 cops. They had found where I work because a friend of the girls dad had messaged me and asked me what I'd been up to lately. I assumed he was just being chatty. They searched me and put me in the cop car and drove me away to the jail. I started crying and trying to talk to the police. But they just ignored me pretty much. They strip searched me, and put me in an isolation cell. I collapsed on the floor crying and screaming for hours. I have a fear of being alone, and a history of self harm and depression and with this on top of it I cried and cried non stop for hours and hours. I'm a grown man, its not easy to admit. My heart was crushed, I didnt know what was going on. They gave me one phone call of 5 minutes after a while and I immediately called my parents. I tried to explain to them everything quickly but at that point I hadn't been told anything other than what the cops said.
They had me talk to a psychiatrist. She evaluated that I was suicidal which I told her I WAS NOT. They stripped me naked, took my blanket and bed and put me in a itchy green vest, the ""the turtle suit"". There I lay alone for about a day and a half. Endlessly crying, for my family, and my amazing girlfriend who I love so much. Screaming and asking why???
Then they had me do a video conference call with the judge.
He set my bail to $25,000 dollars. And charged me with first degree sexual assault of a minor under 11. The pentaly? 25-60 years in federal prison.
I could barely make it back to my cell. I collapsed on the floor when they brought me back.
So they gave me the police report, and I read it, hardly believing what i was reading. The girl was 14 now, and was claiming that 2 years prior, while staying at her house, I came upstairs and raped her when she was sleeping on their living room couch.
My parents scraped together money. And my aunt took out of her retirement money to bail me out. But I didnt really feel any better. I tried to go back to work but I quit half way through and went to live with my parents. I loked myself in my room and spent my days just starting at my computer playing video games and drinking heavily. I cried all the time and my felt so bad. Everything had changed all of a sudden in my life.
The court case still hasn't been dropped almost a year later. The judge wants it to go to trial. The girl's twin sister was sleeping in the living room too on the night she is claiming this happened. Her sister told the police she didnt hear or see anything happen. Both her parents would have been in their room and there were like 3 other kids plus my ex girlfriend downstairs all staying there that night. Everyone that the investigator interviewed said she hadn't said anything about this until she went to her school counselor on a day that they were talking about sexual assault at her school. There is no evidence whatsoever. Her medical reports from a few months after say there are no signs of any sexual activity. Yet the judge won't dismiss the case. He wants a jury to decide.
Now I live by myself in a hotel and have a good job. My relationship with my incredible beautiful and wonderful girlfriend is extremely strained. I think about dying a lot. I think about the girl every single day. I cant figure out why she is doing this to me. I cant understand how a 14 year girl old can be so heartless and evil. I assume she is doing this for attention. Both her parents have threatened to shoot me. I only live about a half hour from them.
I toss and turn at night, when I wake up I think of her. When I am at work it creeps into my brain and it is hard to focus. My girlfriend and I were going to get married this year. But everything is on hold. My whole life is on hold. It feels like I have a terminal illness. And I know what they do to rapists in prison. I know how they treat them. I'd probably be treated the same way if I ended up there. It feels like the end of my life. I'm slowly cutting everyone off and deleted my social media. I feel like I'm making my friends and family sad. Not even sure if I'll go to Thanksgiving or Christmas.

We just stopped talking. I can't balieve it. I fucking lost her and after two years, I still think about her everyday, dream about her, and have my heart broken  everytime I want to reach out to her and don't in fear of her not responding.
I hate that she isn't missing me as much as I miss her, and it really breaks me knowing she probably doesn't even think about me (I stalk her on social media. I guess I want to know how she is doing to feel close to her, but it never works. She is always happy with life and friends and is not preoccupied with this fucking misery that I'm going through - or at least this is how it looks like.)
I tried talking to her about this. I asked if I have done anything wrong. She said no, and that she just preferred being alone. I try to underatand, I really do, but it has nothing to do with the hurt that I'm feeling.
I'm relieved knowing she isn't as miserable. I'm angry at her for not caring about me. And I'm really heartbroken people.

Also, her sister just died so tragically. I can't expect too much, right? BUT I LOST HER TOO. I knew her, she confided in me.

I’ve been think about how I would do it when I try again. A lot of people on here say that they want their death to be painless. I think I would rather my death be extremely painful.

I want the last thing I feel in my life to be the most I’ve ever felt. I want it to feel special, not just slipping away like nothing even happened. 

A lot of other people say they want their suicide to be clean, as in not making much of a mess. To be honest I don’t really care if I get blood everywhere when I do it. Why should I care, it’s not my problem. I don’t have to clean it and I’m perfectly fine with my parents or siblings having to see it.

Required school assignments and the concept of grades always kills my curiosity. So I'm about to drop out again. No job at the moment. No income. Living off of my parents which makes me a total loser. I just won't grow up and take care of my own shit. I wanna take a huge risk, feel something, anything, cause now I barely feel alive. Mostly I just wanna lay in bed, curtains closed, ignore every incoming call or message, mindlessly browse youtube until I fall asleep again. The worst part is I can only find the answers within myself, but right now, as many times before it's pitch black in there
Just needed to vent somewhere",I don't care about myself,1

I’ve had depression for the majority of my life, but these days it feels like I’ve lost all my fighting spirit. It’s really hard for me to find motivation or energy to do things these days, and even most of the things I used to love don’t make me very happy anymore. 

I guess I just want to know if anybody has any advice. It’s my birthday but I feel so alone and down. I don’t want to cry and I keep trying my hardest not to, but it’s like I can’t avoid it. 

I still want to enjoy today. What do you guys do to feel better during times like this? I just want to be able to smile at least once today.",Today’s my birthday,1
361,"I'm so close to just giving up. Every year, everday just gets worse and worse. Waking up every morning and being so completely exhausted. Then at night i wake up a bit and can't sleep.

I was the ""gifted"" child. Almost all A's and some B's. The i got through middle school and my mental shit slapped me in the face. I'm bored, exhausted, crying everyday, and can't fucking take the masks off. I was bullied most of my life and can't remeber a damm thing. The majority of my memories good and bad and even what i did last week or yesterday is gone. 

I'm failing a class and its one of my main classes, plus its an honors class. I want to get lost in my books and music. I want to sleep for a really long time. 

I shouldn't have these problems. I live in a first world country, don't usually have to worry about where my next meal is comming from or where we will live. I'm white, and a cis female. My parents divorced when i was two, and my dad was an alcaholic.

362,"Recently I (17f) have been struggling hard with my depression... I have an eating problem, I have a terrible sleep schedule that messes with my ability to do school work and also work at my job, I have no motivation, especially with schoolwork, (I haven't done any in weeks) I think I've been struggling with undiagnosed ADHD, I have been getting easily angered/agitated which leads to arguments with my mom, my friends don't talk/hangout with me much anymore and I'm just starting to doubt myself all around as a person. (There's much more I could include but its not necessarily the point) 

I always get to these points where I just want to have these breakdowns, like the kind of stuff you see in the movies where people just let it all out all emotionally, like I've thought of just ranting about how much I've been hating my life in my group chat with my friends, or just telling my mom about everything when we get in arguments. I get so set on doing it until I go to actually do it and I just chicken out. Idk I just feel like when I tell people ill become a ""victim"", I don't want to be pitied. I don't want people to suddenly treat me like I'm a baby.

Part of me also is just too embarrassed, especially thinking about having to tell someone in person and having to see how they react, it'll be to awkward for me. I also don't want to be put on medication.

Like I want to talk to somebody but at the same time I don't, in my head I even imagine talking to a therapist but I know in real life Id just be quiet. What should I do?

378,"Hello everyone. So about since quarantine started in March 2020, I have started to come to realize, I am constantly anxious about what seems to be nothing, but feels like everything. I had learned to live with it but a few months later, I was hanging out with my aunt, uncle, and cousins that live far, and I felt a feeling of almost disgust and hopelessness. That was the first time I noticed it (this was in August). After that, I wondered why I would feel that way during that time when I knew that I should be happy to hangout with my family. Besides that all was well until I ultimately started online school in early September. I was doing well for the most part for about 3 weeks, and then I started making excuses to my teacher for not having my camera on, to not responding to any snapchats, to losing interest in playing basketball and lifting, and even to the extent of me not even wanting to play my favorite video games. I had always thought, ""why would any ever want to kill themselves?"" Until, it started to feel like that was the only way out of being constantly overwhelmed with everything. I had experienced the worse of this feeling in mid October, where I would basically lay around all day, yet not be able to fall asleep until around 3 am. This is when the only thing stopping me from doing it was knowing the pain I would cause the people around me. I'm starting to come to a realization, that I should probably talk to someone about these feelings. I want to start playing ball again, and I want to start to workout again, and I want to feel some sort of will for myself rather than based on other people. I am posting this on an anonymous reddit account, even though I almost never use reddit anyways. I feel like this is a step in some sort of right direction, even if its anonymous. I feel like if I came out to the people around me it would just make an awkward situation, and it would be bad. I'm not sure if what I'm experiencing is depression truly, but I want it to stop, or else I feel like the next time I reach another low, I might not make it out.",17 almost 18 and I might need help,1

Lost my job back in September due to having to call off too many times due to pregnancy related issues (constant vomiting, migraine for 48+ hours which caused more vomiting, etc). I applied for unemployment. Got one payment of unemployment back in the beginning of October. Husband works 12 hour shifts. Due to being pregnant, I’m already highly fucking emotional. I have no desire to do anything. I don’t want to clean, I don’t want to cook. I don’t even want to microwave myself something to eat because that means I’d have to clean my bowl, and god I don’t have the energy for that. 

Unemployment has not paid me the last 3 fucking times I’ve filed my claims. No one has emailed me back. You can’t even call them, you just get a constant busy tone.

380,"I should be happy. I have every right to be. I'm married. I have a kid. Things are tough with no job, but we're making by just fine and at no threat to our stability, but I can't shake this. My wife has been somewhat abusive throughout the years. She is extremely manipulative and manages to make everything about herself. This last year I had kind of reached my breaking point and began to act out a little. Instead of just aggreeing with her or stepping around potential arguments I would argue about the littlest thing to make me feel some sense of independent or identity. Stand my ground. I got angrier and bitter.   


Then with the last few months she's suddenly flipped the script and has been saying that because now I'm standing up for myself and my own needs and identity that I'm arrogant. That I'm unwilling to work on our relationship. It makes me feel insane.  


I was raised with the idea that you sacrifice your own happiness for the sake of your family.  I love my kid more than life itself. I don't know if I truly love my wife anymore. I'm more, and more miserable as the days go by and I feel like a selfish prick for wanting things for myself. For wanting more. For wanting something different, because this is just eating me alive.   


This last week things took an... interesting turn as well though. A friend of mine left his wife of several years. He's happy. He's focused. He has set clear goals for what he wants to do from here on out and I was SO jealous of that feeling. Of that freedom. Of being in control of his own life again. Then a few days ago someone I used to have a bit of a crush on but didn't really do much about straight up snet me a book of a message stating how she couldn't hide the fact that she had very intense feelings for me for the longest time and that it bothered her to see how unhappy I have looked lately. And.... It felt so good. I feel so guilty for it feeling good, but it really, truly does. I haven't taken it anywhere or anything. I hardly responded, but the fact it was put out there like that made me feel noticed in a way I hadn't felt in so god damn long...  


I think the bottom line of all this is that I feel like my life has been largely controlled by other people. Especially lately. I feel like I haven't been in control in years and I've been slowly trying to claw back that sense of control however I can and I feel guilty because it feels like it comes at, or will come at my family's expense, but I just simply don't know what else to do. I'm at a breaking point and I'm falling apart. I don't want my kid to grow up seeing me like this. But I don't want them poisoned by my wife like I experienced my parents did when I was a kid...

382,"I’ve noticed over the past few weeks my mood has taken a shift. I’ve always been depressed but I feel lately I’m just not up to fighting it like usual. I’m finding the things I usually enjoy doing not appealing anymore, my online friends I usually talk with I try to avoid or keep our conversations as short as possible. I’m withdrawing from everyone and I even noticed it at work as I try to not to interact with people. 

I can’t tell my family this. I wouldn’t. My brother is sensitive and he’d freak out. My dad doesn’t really believe in depression or something. Being sad to means being sick and that should only need like 3 therapy sessions to fix according to him. My mom is not really around anymore since she’s helping my grandma recover from a stroke. 

I just feel I’ve become increasingly sad over the last couple of weeks. I don’t really like myself, people say you should love yourself but I don’t think I ever really have. Right now I’m taking online classes that require my camera be on and I hate it. I see myself and I feel absolutely disgusted. Then I feel depressed after the disgusted feeling leaves me. I hate feeling this way about myself. It not right but it’s how I feel. 

Today I was looking at my bank stuff and to put it simply I’m struggling. Granted I live with my family but I have medical bills and student debt piling on. My part time paycheck can’t handle it. Sometimes I feel like I need to get a second job because I can’t find a full time job. Finding a new job has been something that’s also making me depressed. If I need money and have to borrow from my dad he talks down to me I’m almost a belittling fashion that makes me sick and angry. 

I’m so tired of feeling belittled but I don’t have the funds to move. My mom would usually have my back but again she has more important things at the moment. Being home with my dad isn’t helping. The way he talks to me leaves me feeling like dirt. Trash even.  

I know my depression is getting worse. I can’t sleep for more than 3 hours at a time, I don’t want to do anything except stay in bed, and human interact no longer interests me. I’m beginning to think about selling the few decently priced things I own, taking out what little money I have in the bank and leaving that for my family before offing myself.

384,"So, I just read a post on “The Story of Jennifer Pan.” And oh God, I’m a mess of tears right now. I really don’t want to burden y’all with my life story, it’s okay if you don’t read all this, but I need to pen this down. I don’t know what my life has come to. I topped my high school six months ago and even got a grade that less than one per cent of the people get in my curriculum. I’ve been painted as a world topper and a golden girl throughout my life. My parents have always been proud of me. But I think that’s breaking apart. I feel like I’m leading a double life. I really don’t know what to do. I’m really scared of my past self. She could achieve everything and anything, but now, I think I’ve set myself up for failure. I really think I’m pretending to be someone I’m not. It’s like I’m a different person? And that scares me so fucking much.

So, the backstory: The first life I’m leading is of an insanely talented girl who can do pretty much everything. Academics, music, dance, everything. She is pretty much perfect on paper. But, my second identity is beyond disgusting. I have been suffering from internet addiction for 6 years. It all started with porn. I started consuming porn, masturbating and even seeing sexual violence since I was barely 10 and whenever I think of it, I feel so ashamed of that. As a child, I didn’t even know what porn was, so I feel like I’ve irreparably damaged a part of myself by watching porn too early.

I desperately wanted out. I tried everything: talking more, exercising, diet, everything. But nothing was working out. I then got to know that porn encourages sexual trafficking and whatnot, so I knew I had to stop this, for its victims, if not for myself. That’s why I decided to replace my addiction. I knew I couldn’t get off the internet. So, I started consuming Japanese anime, YouTube, dramas, online TV shows, online pirated movies, K-Pop/Dramas, and everything online. This replacement of addiction was and still is very unhealthy. My exercise, diet, sleep schedule, work, study, family life, relationships, everything is ruined.

I have started university now. And my professors and dean think I’m still that perfect girl. But I swear to God, there isn’t one single day that’s gone by without me sobbing about my problems. Every night, I cry myself to sleep. My semester exams are in a few days. I’m trying to study, but it’s impossible to know when I’ll slip. My mum knows about my internet addiction phases, I confessed to her during my 18th birthday, though, I lied and said, I’ve gotten over it. But apart from that, no one else has a clue. I hide myself very well. But it hurts so much. I really want to stop. There are times, when I get my life back together, start studying, exercising, sleeping well, but this only lasts for a few days. Then, I’m back to using the internet and wasting all the time I have. I keep slipping. No matter how much effort i put in, I can't seem to reach my goals. It's hopeless.

When I’m in my ‘sober’ state (like I’m now, as I write), I’m fine, I can see clearly, but then, when I crave for the internet, it’s like I’m another person. And I’ve been that other person for 6 years now. That’s more than a third of my life. I feel like being addicted to the internet has become a part of my identity. I even have high-power glasses now. People think it’s because I study so much. Lord, only if they knew. My eyesight is so bad that I worry I’ll go blind one day. But I really can’t stay away. I’ve tried installing website blockers but, those don’t work on me anymore. It’s futile. I feel hopeless. I’m so tired. I’ve been running in circles for years now, I wish this could stop.

I have been through my share of psychological troubles as well. I don’t like to speak about this, so I’ll keep this short. 2 years before I started watching porn, I myself was molested by some old sick guy in a swimming pool, at my friend’s birthday party. I didn’t even know what molestation was then, this still rips my heart. Growing up, I’ve seen all kinds of inappropriate photos on my dad’s phone, that belonged to other guys’ private parts. I still don’t know; we don’t talk about this (and will never) but it was only natural to conclude that he was gay. I knew that he used Grindr, and cheated often. My mum knows it too, and we did have a lot of violent fights about it. My dad has hit my mum many times and my mum has wreaked havoc multiple times as well. Divorce has been brought up often. It’s like the whole family has split personalities. Also, I'm Asian. So, that really adds up to the whole ""looking good in front of society"" and stuff, I'm not getting into that now.

I just. I really don’t want to justify my disgusting behaviour with all my personal issues, but I don’t know, it feels good to confess everything to the void. I’m so tired right now. I’ve used the internet to escape reality. I really have tried to run away from all my problems. But I think now, I’ve run so far away, that I don’t know my way back. I’m lost. Realistically, the only thing I see is a failure. I’ve never failed significantly in my life before, and if I do right now, I think my parents would react very badly. On paper, we’re the perfect family, but in real life, I’m really struggling. I don’t have the freedom to fail, but I’m so scared I might fail this time. My parents keep saying they don't care about grades, but I still take the pressure. I'm guilty of not working as hard and being addicted to crap, so it's very much my fault.

I need to study more, but I keep getting distracted. What’s worse is if I try to break away from watching dramas, I end up going back to porn. I don’t know what to do. I had once thought I had the strongest will in the entire universe, but now, I feel really shameful and pathetic. I don’t know anyone who has weaker willpower than me. On some days, I feel regret, on the other days, I don’t care about the consequences of my actions. Sometimes I’m glad that I cry about it, cause it’s worse if I don’t. It’s worse when I don’t care at all. I don’t know. I don’t know if I can go back to the talented girl everyone knew and loved. Quarantine had got the worst out of me and each day, I go back to the internet.

The reason I’m writing this is to promise myself for the 10000th time I’ll stop. I don’t want to ruin my life. I don’t care about what I feel, cause if I keep caring about my personal fantasies, it’ll be too late. My parents, no matter how fucked up they might be, they care a lot. They support me through everything. They are genuinely great parents, if not husband and wife. I don’t know if my ‘addicted’ self wants to stop or not, but I need to stop and focus on my education. I feel like I’ve been addicted all my life, so I don’t know if I can even live a life that’s free of internet addiction. But, I really want to try. Once again. I’m just tired. I can’t recognise myself anymore.

385,"For a long time I’ve felt just empty and unable to do anything without having self doubted thoughts. I was physically abused by my step father when I was around 12 years old (5 years ago) which left me completely and utterly shocked as how someone I looked up to could just change in seconds. I feel like that’s apart of why I have difficulties trusting people and opening up about my feelings.

I’ve been very unsure if I’m truly depressed or not. I always think I’m just sad as I’ve seen many people have it way worse and have been through worse too. I’m also afraid to tell my mother about anything because I don’t want her to worry about me.",I can’t open up to anyone about my feelings,1

Multiple family members died, with my grandmother’s death hitting the hardest.

My family is tearing itself apart at the seams, slinging out old grudges or collecting new ones.

I chose to go to community college this year, to save money. Smart. What wasn’t was falling into a spiral and being weeks behind on school work. I’m resigned to failing the semester at this point, and falling short of everyones’ expectations.

My friend group dwindled from lack of communication and time until I’m left with only one, who I feel I’m treating more as my unpaid therapist than a friend. I know it’s bad, even when she says it’s okay, but when I finally have someone who listens I get addicted to that feeling of being heard.

The worst thing is the resignation. The apathy that seeps into my core. Everything is washed out, gray and it’s hard to find that spark that makes life a miracle instead of a burden. Making it to my 20s  would be a blessing.

Now, I’m just 19 and miserable.

391,"I feel so stuck. I'm a 19 year old female (20 in April) and I feel like I've completely wasted my teenage years. I had social anxiety and never made friends easily and was super depressed. I moved to a new city last year and things were the same for a while, until I met some really cool people this year. We had a really good couple of months, had 2 really close friends who basically lived with me and we spent all our time together just drinking, smoking and playing video games (we were in lockdown so couldn't do much else). One of them went back to their home country and the other turned out to be a narsistic, manipulative asshole when our friend left. 

I'm now completely alone, with a puppy who I love but makes my life a bit harder. I'm in uni, but thinking of changing courses because the employment rates are low after grad for this degree. I'm dirt poor and can't work because my puppy needs constant attention. 

I've basically become a recluse. I want to meet more people and have friends but I feel like I just repel people. I always have and idk what it is. 

I spend most of my days walking around aimlessly on the brink of tears because I have nothing or no one. My life is miserable and lonely and I don't know what to do. I have no one to talk to about any of this shit. My closest friend is in his home country and I think he's had enough of my bullshit. He completely ignores me now and he's moving in with our asshole friend when he comes back. 

I'm so lost and my depression is coming back in full force with a sprinkle of anxiety. I feel like my life is never going to get better and I'm going to end up like my parents, old, broke, bored and miserable.

I feel like there is no one who understands me.. but then again how can they? I am a very complex person and there are times when I feel I can’t even understand myself. 
I want to love myself and be happy. That is all I have ever wanted. The worst part is, I know that the only person holding me back from this is, ultimately, me. I don’t know how to stop it.... or maybe I do but I continue this way because pain is what’s familiar to me. It all goes back to fear... I’m scared. Not just surface fear but a deep rooted one that stems from one thought. “What if I am not good enough?” What if all I’ll ever feel is this consuming disappointment in myself and the world around me. How do I fix this? How do I fix myself? Most importantly, how do I forgive myself? How do I move forward?

It made my friend who was more of a brother to me, leave just because I'm too happy to understand what he's going through and that was a big big disappointment for me. A hole in my heart.

I never truly felt that I have support. I never truly felt that there's someone mature enough I could count on and feel safe. My mother, although she offered me and my siblings as much as she could and I'm pretty sure she would die for us if she had do, she had her own problems. 

I didn't notice it when I was young, I thought it was normal, but I do now. 

At primary school I was a really loud and active child. I couldn't sit still for one second and my grades were low and I was nothing but trouble. At home I wasn't that active and loud but I couldn't concentrate and do my homework. I remember my mom shouting at me and telling me to stop playing and do my homework. I remember struggling over a piece of paper for hours, I remember crying and wondering why can't I concentrate. 

In 5th grade I wrote a suicide note (i don't remember what I wrote) and I took my pencil and I put it against my belly and I was crying. I wasn't going to do it, but the sadness for some reason, was comforting. I don't know how to  describe it.

In 6th grade the teacher told my mom that I may have ADHD. My mom agreed and said we are going to look into it. (Ironically it was the teacher I hated the most for some reason) 

That discovery could have changed my life, but the phycologist that we went to didn't ""feel comfortable"" diagnosing me at such a young age and instead they said we are going to take all my responsibilities and create some short of a game or bullshit.

Basically they made a planner, with the difference that if I stick to it for one week then something cool happens idk.

That planner was useless. I couldn't follow. It. One day I lost it and that was it. 


For some reason we stopped going to the phycologist .

My life continued as it was before. Anxiety, feelings of worthlessness my mom shouting and telling me to do my homework. 

Now about relationships and the people in my life.


My dad left me when I was 2. He went back to were he came from, Canada because life wasn't as he thought it was in my country. 

Basically my grandpa was from my country, then went to canada, then felt nostalgic for my country, then he wanted to go back to my country and do business there, Dad went with him, Dad met mom, they made me, business went bankrupt, Dad owned thousands and fled back to Canada. 

My dad kept phone contact and was  helping my mother financially as he should have. But he wasn't *there* . He was just someone I would talk to every week and call dad. 

My mom decided we have to move away (I was 4 yo)  and go to a different city with an army guy she met. 

I grew up with him and he was actually really cool. Half a year passed and I decided to started calling him ""Dad"" . 

He was actually *there* . Unlike my real dad. 

I continued speaking to my real dad.

My mom gave birth to my sister and then my brother

9 years passed end  my stepdad and  mom started not getting along so well. They wouldn't fight in front of us all the time at first, but you could feel it. In the air. Things weren't nice. 

One day my mom and step dad told me that they are going to break up. I was young, I couldn't handle it I started crying. 

Some days pass and my little stepbrother had been taken by his grandfather ( stepdads father) from school early without my moms permission. When she found out he called him and demanded that he return my brother. 

When they arrived grandpa pushed my mom and was hitting and pushing her and shouting things at her. I couldn't believe what was happening.

I saw my siblings crying and hiding under the kitchen table, shouting ""don hurt our mom""

 My mom told me to call the police. 

Without a second thought I rushed to the phone and then I tried to leave  the house. Grandpa run after me. I smashed his fingers to the door on my way out. I run one street away. I called the police. He got scared and left. 

That happened years ago. But I believe it changed me.

Stepdad learned what happened and said that he will never talk to his parents again after what they did. 

I kept visiting my ""dad"" together with my siblings every other weekend. He was my dad after all. I knew him all my life. 

Then I found out that he still had contact with the man who was one step away of murdering my mother. 

I didn't want to visit him after that. I got scared.

AND HE DIDN'T CALL ONCE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

HE DIDN'T CARE. 

I KNEW THIS PERSON FOR 9 YEARS. I CALLED THIS PERSON MY DAD.

APPARENTLY HE DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.

Anyways I developed strong trust issues after that. So strong in fact, that I didn't want to do  ANYTHING with the next person my mom met.

I didn't even say hello at first. I would just lock myself into a room.

 My mom got annoyed at first. Then angry. Then she straight up was forcing me to act nice and letting his children in my room, and play with my stuff. 

That made my resentment stronger.

My relationships with my mom got worse. We would argue often. I became more rebellious. I became depressed I would just play video games until I got to sleep. I felt like I was alone and didn't have support.

My mom would find every opportunity to leave the house and have fun. I didn't mind that, since I would also get time to be alone, but I also wanted a supporting  parent. 

2 years passed and we moved closer to my mom's boyfriend. I had started to get used to him and we started having friendly conversations but i also kept my distance. 

My mom had problems with her ex. He was apparently batshit crazy all this time. He demanded the costudy of my siblings. He would take every opportunity to make my mom's life as difficult as possible. 

This weant on for years. My mom got paranoid. The only thing she would talk about was this. She would get upset and annoyed. She would get angry. We would fight often he got violent often.


I didn't feel loved. I didn't have anyone to talk to. I was alone. I felt trapped in there. Though I was going insane.

My mom became a monster in my eyes. She became scary. She would scream over nothing. She would force me to listen to her screams. 

I started recording her screams, taking pictures of scratches.

One day she found out I am was recording her and charged on me with and started hitting me demanding that I stop. I used my leg to push her away so I could free myself. She called her boyfriend (who is a cop) to come and help.

I heard the door break open, he rushed upstairs he asked me what did I do and before I could explain he started hitting me with the baton. 

I got into a fetal position he hit my head with the baton. I begged him to stop. He got my phone and he demanded me to delete all the videos. I complied.

Then his supervisor called and he said he will get in trouble for this and he left.

I called my real dad and told him I must get out of here. He agreed.

I call child services and they give me the phone of a district attorney they also demanded names of my mother and her boyfriend.

Couple of days passed and I pretty much tell her that if I'm not in Canada by the end of summer I call the attorney and she losses her children ( because her ex is currently asking for custody) 

She couldn't refuse. 

I arrived to canada 4 months ago.


It was a huge relief it took me a long to notice it. But when I did, I stated crying. I was crying so much. Relief, anger, sadness, happines. I felt all these feelings at the same time.


I'm grade 11 and I already know I'm failing physics. I can't concentrate, the teacher is terrible and we are moving so quick.
 
I got depressed  and stressed really quickly then numb. Now im depressed again. I'm directionless,  i dont know what to do with my life. I dont know. What I'm doing. I think now that I have more time to reflect on myself my adhd is worse than i thought. I get angry quickly. I snap at people. I can't seem to have emotions. Real emotions. I shield myself from others. I can't communicate. Words aren't coming from my mouth. 


I have lost the path. 


No. I don't trust my dad. I'm taking advantage of him. He wasn't anywhere to be found all my live. I don't feel any emotional connection. I don't love him. He says he does, so does my mom, but I dont. I don't feel that way. And I can't choose what i feel. He is better than my mom and he has done great things but if it you gave me a pistol and said to kill myself or him id kill him no second thoughts.


And I feel alone. Im propably really damaged. I do substance abuse. There's no alcohol but I drink vinegar and worcestershire sauce. I drink redbull but I'm always low energy. I feel dirty.

We broke up 2 months ago. After 4 years of relationship and living together.

I can't take it anymore, I've been struggling so hard, I feel so Lonley and miserable, everything made worse by covid and quarantine.

I started taking making heavy use of light drugs ever since we broke up, even tho I've never used drugs before in my life. After so many years of struggling with depression anxiety and stress I gave in.

I'm high everyday for the last 4 months, I can't remember a day where I fall asleep normally.i always collapse from being high. I have problems with my memory due to this use of drugs, my once really good memory is absolutely going to shit because of drugs, but it's the only thing that gives me a hint of relief.


It really helps me to not think when I'm high, time goes faster and I don't feel as bad. But it's sick, I can't keep this up.


I keep. Dreaming about her every day, I promise you, EVERY DAY! It's the same dreams, she cheats on me, she treats me bad, she hurts me, she leaves me, and I wake up and start crying like a miserable rat, I'm so. Disappointed in myself and ashamed I've allowed a person to ruin my life this way.
 Even during our relationship she was always very abusive mentally. And I often had those dreams, but now it's every single day



I keep dreaming about this because I cannot accept that such bad person such as her already found a boyfriend  1 or 2 weeks after we broke up, I just can't accept it. Why bad people get everything their way? Why doesn't karma work on these people?

I get absolutely sick to my stomach when I think about it, how can you say you've loved someone, and find a boyfriend a week after breaking up? It's madness.

I normally don't seek for help like this or help in general, but I'm absolutely broken down, I'm crying as I write this.

I just feel like i cant keep being strong, I can't keep living my life on will power alone, it's not enough. I've already given in to light drugs, even tho I hated drugs before. I don't want to do more stupid shit to ruin my future...

One of the things that helps me cope when I feel bad is driving, I love going for long drives and enjoy being outside, however it's very dangerous as I've been in 2 accidents before due to driving after something bad happen in my relationship, and I ended up crashing due to distracting, I'm scared to end up in another accident.

Before telling me to seek therapy, I can't afford to do so. Even tho I live in the EU, mental health isn't taken seriously here, and you have to pay for, even tho health care is supposed to be free...

It amazes me that there are people who walk this earth content and happy without their brains trying to sabotage them. My brain isn’t complete. It literally cannot do a task it was meant to do, and I lack the chemicals that allow me to feel. I never feel happy, I never feel joy. I just feel a lingering sadness sometimes accompanied by intense anger towards myself. I hate it that I’m broken and that my brain doesn’t work the way it’s supposed to. I hate how slow I am in college and how long it takes me to understand things. I hate how tired I feel all the time. I hate these suicidal thoughts that seem to get just a little louder each day. I hate it that I can never be normal on my own, and the medication I’m on isn’t even enough to make me feel normal. I am a broken human, and I just feel worthless.

434,"It’s been a little over a year since I tried to take my own life. It’s wild to think about now because I feel like a different person from who I was back then. It’s scary to me too, remembering how fixated I was on dying. How completely checked out I was. How despondent and dark I must’ve seemed. A complete shell of a person. 

Somehow I survived and it was honestly a wake up call. I wish it didn’t have to happen for me to realize how precious my life is, but at least I survived... The first few weeks were rough afterwards, even with my new attitude towards life. Honestly it took me a while to get ahold of reality. I even questioned whether I was alive or dead a few times. I started to backtrack on my recent events and realized how much pain I put my boyfriend through while I was hurting. The moral hangover was real.... 

But then I made a conscious decision. I was not going to die anymore. I was going to love my life and live it to the fullest. I began to speak it into existence and manifest my own happiness. Now I live everyday with conscious gratitude. The dark cloud that followed me is gone; the darkness that consumed me has vanished. Not only am I happy to be alive, but I look forward to my future. 

I never thought I could have this. I never thought I would be happy. I never thought I’d want anything more than to end it. I never thought I’d have a future. But I do! And I’m beginning to forgive myself because I deserve it. I deserve to be happy. I deserve to have a future. I deserve to love myself. 

I just want everyone to know that it will be okay. I know it doesn’t seem like it now, but you will be okay. If you’re feeling anything like what I was feeling back then, I encourage you to try to see yourself in the light of someone you love. Because you deserve love, especially from yourself.

My mom really wants me to get a job and volunteer. I want to do it so she doesn’t get mad at me, but for the past month or so, i’ve been in a drought. 

I’ve probably spent at least 6-8 hours a day for the past week trying to find something that peaks my interest. I want to find something that at least won’t propel my depression into descending even further. 

The problem i’m having is, I have absolutely no drive. The mere thought of working right now has me leaning towards the edge of a cliff. 

There are very little options for work, as I live in a phenomenally small town. I cant find anything I’ll enjoy unless I drive at least an hour out. 
I worry about my ability to work, and my motivation for doing so if I even struggle to get out of bed lately. I had to force myself to take a shower the other day and it drained me of my energy. How pathetic, i know. 

Maybe one would say to handle my depression before getting a job, but doing so would make my parents view me as incompetent. As lazy.

I don’t want anyone to think I use my depression as an excuse. I’m afraid what will happen if I tell my mom and dad how i’ve been feeling lately. I think they’d say that i’m just nervous about getting a new job. 

I want to stop existing for a little bit. Just so I can at least get a grip on things. It feels as though things are moving at warp speed and my feet are cemented to the ground. It’s so frustrating. I wish I could push myself to do everything that I should be doing, but I don’t feel capable.

My turnaround for projects was the quickest out of the five of us in my department with very few mistakes. Then I started drinking and developed an addiction to alcohol.

My production slowed down, by a lot. About a year ago, my sixth year, I had a six-month stint of sobriety. My production was still slow. During that time I was diagnosed with mild depression. I say mild depression because I didn't want to be hauled away for having suicidal thoughts so I didn't tell my psychologist. That would take me from a 7 to a 21. I'm severely depressed. Turns out I was always depressed. Drinking just made it worse.

At my company the VP of Production basically oversees the entire company and besides payroll is the only person who knows everyone's salary. He is my boss's boss. So as ""logic"" dictates, he was the one who gave my review in August and basically told me to do better or he'll have to let me go. Just last week in the ""We need to be better at following the COVID guidelines"" email, he mentioned the fact that we are an employee owned company (ESOP) and missed work from COVID impacts everyone's benefits. Last month he let the shop scheduler go with very little notice and had a replacement within a week. So even before my review, I knew I could be next.

It's November now. This afternoon I get a call from my boss telling me that my performance has not improved. Now, I respect this guy. He maybe takes the ""do well or I'll tease you endlessly about it"" approach to managing too far, but he is always upfront about what is expected and will warn you when he thinks something is coming which will affect you. Starting to see the writing on the wall and out of desperation, I felt that it was okay to open up to him about being depressed. I said, ""The reason I didn't tell you before is that I don't know of anything you can do for me."" He said that he was sorry for me and we will see how things go after thirty days. Him mentioning 30 days told me that after that period of time, I would be let go for poor performance.

I will start a new medication tomorrow, as chance would have it. It has been three days that I have been off med's to clear my system (doctor's orders). I have already been applying to jobs in my area, but right now I am not in a good head space. For weeks I have been waking up, contemplating the job, and weighing that against suicide before stifling the thought and taking a shower. Now I HAVE to look for a new job. Great. Work AFTER work.

My wife is pushing me to find a new job, any job. She works full time at a job she hates, taking college classes online, is also looking for a job, and is very concerned. With such a rock star wife, I feel even more ineffectual.

Right now it is taking all my willpower to stay away from booze because I feel so worthless and helpless. I have nothing going for me. I'm almost ready to give up on trying to get better at all; cut all ties and circle the drain til I die. Because if I'm going to die, might as well enjoy the ride. Not today though.

I have been working from home as much as I can (approx. 40 out of 45 hrs/week).

I live in Minnesota, US.

I continue to stay sober, thanks to my friends in AA. They literally saved my life.

In conclusion, here are the specific things for which I need advice:

1. Now that I have told my boss about my depression, what do I need to do to protect myself?
2. In an effort to keep my job, what sort of accommodations can help me with my motivation and focus?
3. My wife and I have health insurance through my work. What are my options if I get let go?

Please lend me any advice to any of this, including if there is a better place to post this. I'll try to include answers to questions as edits below this text in addition to comments.","Design engineer with 7 years at my company, and the low motivation/focus from my depression has got me 30 days to improve or I'm out.

455,"This is one of my first times being completely open about my depression. For years I’ve struggled, years and years. It got better and worse like always. It started because I watched my mother die when I was 14. From there on everything was bleak and dim. I trucked through highschool, skipping classes and barely passing with an impressive 1.36 GPA. I worked shit job after shit job until I met a girl whom I fell madly in love with. I spent the next 5 years growing with this person and loving them. Learning about myself and growing to become happier and more positive about life and myself in general. For once I felt wanted and I seen a future, a very bright one. I found my purpose I guess. I dropped everyone I knew for the most part and focused on us because that was what I wanted and needed. I needed her to be my wife and we mutually agreed on getting married multiple times. Year 5 comes along and I get promoted at work, I start looking at rings and the possibility of also buying a house with her. Everything was finally perfect. Right in the beginning of the COVID shit she comes home from work and im giddy as fuck to see her. I made sure the house was clean and everything. The first words she said to me were “I don’t love you anymore” my world crashed honestly and I spiraled into a fucking mess since. I do fine then I get hit with a massive wave of sad that I can’t break for weeks and weeks now. I’m struggling. Maybe Reddit isn’t the place to be sharing or posting all of this but I just need the thoughts out of my head and into something else. At 28 I never thought I’d be in this spot.

456,"Being a Woman is a gift; a privilege. Being a Man is a curse. Men are treated like 2nd class humans. You are inherently devalued and have to prove yourself. You are expected to be a provider, an ATM, despite Women having more earning oppurtunities. You are the job seeker, expected to prove yourself. Heck you are attacked for even daring to have standards in who you date; just cause you want a fair deal. While Women are the employers, getting a bunch of resumes and getting to decide. Being a Woman is a life of constant valuation and self-esteem boosts. It means being easily able to hook up under our new hook-up system resulting many Men being denied love in their 20s and having to be with someone who slept around when younger. That's not love. That's called being used. Being a Woman being cared and catered to more by those around you. It means getting valued for existing.

I'm not saying Women do not face problems. But absent pregnancies, all their problems are also faced by Men while Men face unique problems. It is rare for a Woman to be unloved and single unless it is by choice while it is common for a Man. And as a whole they have it easier. And that needs to change. Men shouldn't suffer just because they were cursed into being Men.",Society needs to recognize that Women live significantly easier lives compared to Men,1

My health has taken a beating and I don't know where to go from here. I never thought I'd think about dying, but lately it's been pretty much at the forefront of my mind. I'm stuck. I'm so frustrated and mad at myself for not making the effort to do anything at all. 

Sometimes I'll get out of bed, then I think of one of my emotional triggers and I get back into bed. I don't know what I have to live for and I don't know what I can do to make life have a point. I feel so alone every day. I have no one to talk to because no one wants to deal with a depressed mess, which I understand.

Edit : So, tonight's depression turned in to something it hasn't for a long time. I got completely angry. Like a total rage-fest.

Sometimes nips at my heels

Sometimes pounces and crushes me

Sometimes trails behind

But I know it's always there

Tells me not to make a scene

Tells me not to spill the beans

Am I the only one who sees this beast?

Content and surrounded

I still feel its stare

Still hear its mutters

And my head is pounding

As I silently scream

Can't stop the constant worries and stress

They paid for our French bulldog as a wedding present (before we got married) and when they kept making excuses we told them not to bother coming to the wedding if this is how they are going to act, and they asked for the money back for the dog so I gave it to them and told them to never talk to me again. I never asked for the money in the first place they only did it because our previous dog died on his first birthday and insisted on buying us another one. 

I feel like I am there for everybody when they need and when I need help nobody is there for me, mentally or when I need physical help with something. To be told “I wont be there for the next freak out” to me is no different then somebody not being there for someone with depression, only mine is anger problems now turning depression maybe? I don’t socialize very well and literally only had him as a friend so to find new friends is pretty well out of the question. I’ve never been into the party scene, I’m 28 and always been a bit mature for my age and never got into the bars or anything, never had groups of friends and always kept to myself mostly... now I can’t help but think am I really that bad and miserable to be around?

Now my hands are as heavy as stone, and i feel as cold as polished marble. Everything feels grey, except for very few, brief moments of laughter. I've tried getting help before, I've tried reaching out.. but i'm still so confused. Nobody around me seems to be able to understand what i'm going through.

It's been like this for almost 3 years now. This.. sickly, vile apathy slowly building up in my feet, rising in intensity. I'm stumbling blind, looking for answers in places i'm not entirely sure has them. I've tried getting therapy, god knows I've tried. but I've never been able to continue to my next session, mostly due to complications.

I've fallen so far, brought down so low, I've come to the internet in search of answers. Albeit, it's most likely going to be fruitless. though it's better to try than not at all. if not answers, just a little soapbox of my own that i can use to talk about my problem.

504,"Let's just get straight to it. My dad is an alcoholic. He has been to rehab SIX TIMES. SIX! He has been drinking even before I was born, and he continues to drink to this day. He's drunk right now. 

In July of 2019, my mental health took a nosedive after my gf at the time left me for another guy. I stopped eating, I stopped cleaning my house, and I did nothing but sleep. I had no motivation to do anything. I thought about killing myself, and decided to check myself into the hospital. I spent 5 days in the psych ward, and during that whole time, my father had the ability to visit me. Did he? No. 

From what my brother told me, during the time I spent in the hospital, he decided it was a great time to go the bar. Every day I was there. Now, my parents have been split up for the past 12 years. But, my brother was staying at my father's house because my mother was in Europe. Anyway, my dad decided he should get drunk every day I was at the hospital, and didn't even bother to come visit me. My brother said he wanted to visit one day, but, he was hammered, and he wanted to go visit me at 11 in the fucking evening. That's how drunk he was. The fact that he never bothered to even visit me during my entire time really hurt me. But, it also showed me that my dad cares a lot more about drinking than visiting his depressed son. He has always been this way.

When I was 11, I was in baseball, and one day, he showed up at my baseball game completely drunk. I was so embarrassed, and really really hurt. After the game, teammates were making fun of me: ""Hey, I really like your dad. He seems fun."" ""Hey, when's your dad coming to the next game?"" I was hurt, but, I had to go to the next game, and when I did, one of the teammates brought a can of beer, gave it to me, and said ""I know your dad loves these."" I asked my mom if we could leave. I told her I wasn't feeling well. I went home, and decided to quit baseball. I told my mom that it was because I wasn't having fun, but, in reality, I didn't want to keep playing because I didn't want to keep being bullied by the other kids, and being embarrassed whenever my dad showed up drunk.

My dad continued to drink. About 5 years ago, my brother and I visited him for Christmas. I thought it would be nice. On Christmas Eve, he said he was going out to the store. Usually it's about a half hour walk. (He lost his driving license due to a DWI) He came back, FIVE HOURS LATER, absolutely hammered. On Christmas Eve. I was furious. I wanted to leave, but, I didn't want to ruin everyone's Christmas. So, I kept my mouth shut.

I stopped talking to him after that. I ignored his texts, and I came up with excuses to avoid speaking to him. This all circles back to when I was in the hospital. In September of 2019, my supervisor told me she would have to cut my hours. No reason given. I was barely making any money to live on. I couldn't pay my bills, and for a while, I had to park my car, and walk to work because I couldn't afford insurance. So, my dad decided to move in with me, and said he would pay the bills.

I was really upset with this decision. I didn't want him to move in with me, but, I had no other choice. Ever since then, I have had to deal with his drinking. CONSTANT DRINKING. I have screamed at him, and pleaded with him to stop drinking, and he doesn't listen. I have even grown to dread the sound of a can opening.

Soon, it was winter. 3 months after he moved in. Dad said he was ""going to the store"". It was about 10:30 PM, and I hear a knock at the door. I open the door, and there are two police officers holding my dad up. He was REALLY drunk. He had a black eye, and a bloody nose. I knew one of the officers. He's a friend of mine from school. So, I knew they didn't do it. My dad couldn't even stand, but, he drunkenly told me he was walking home, and fell, and struck his head on the curb. I just left him to watch tv, and went upstairs and cried myself to sleep.

Since then, my father has wondered why I don't come into the store with him. It's because 9/10, he's drunk, and I don't want to be embarrassed anymore. He wonders why I don't come downstairs. He wonders why I don't spend time with him. It's because he's drunk, and I don't want to spend time with someone who is drunk.

I know that through all of these things I have written you probably think ""man, your dad is a shitty person."" Yes, he is. When he drinks. When my dad is sober, he is a very good man: he was a private in the army, he was president of the FFA in my area, and he has a master's degree, which he could have used towards becoming a teacher. But, he has had his share of shitty things. My grandfather died when my dad was 28, and it hit my dad really hard from what my aunt told me. 

But, I do have a lot to credit him for. I get my taste in music from him, and I get my taste in TV because of him. But, I still know that at the end of the day he will be my drunk father that I have very little respect for.

If you have read this whole thing, I thank you very much for taking your time to read. I'll conclude with one final thing: if you, or a family member, or someone you just care about has a drinking problem, get some help. You could be doing a big favor to yourself, or anyone else you care about.",I am the closest I have ever come to kicking the shit out of my father.,1
505,"hi everyone first post here. how do you all (that feel this way) come back from thinking that everything you say or do isn’t the real you or is just peformative. I find I feel this the most when i’m in groups of even close friends; even though i’m enjoying my time with them there will be times I step back mentally and wonder if that’s the real me or if i’m just performing what is expected of me with friends. I know this is sort of repeated mental shift I have to keep telling myself that it really is me and all my actions and thoughts are who I really am but it’s gotten of course much worse with being alone for long periods of time during covid and spending so much time alone. but even with my closest friends sometimes it feels like i’m just acting like what they expect me to be so that nothing feels off. it breaks me down inside at night pondering this and has given me many sleepless nights wondering if my happy times aren’t the real me then who is. just interested in knowing what everyone else does during moments like these where they feel like they don’t belong

506,"At this time, I am probably the most stable and least depressed (albeit increasingly lazy and bitter) as I've been in 10+ years. But I'm missing any deeper human connection for the past 7+ years.

I'm torn apart, because I know one part of me is definitely terrified to hold any kind of deeper connection, terrified of rejection, terrified of my own potential instability, among other fears.

The other part of me wants for a close connection. I daydream about it, laugh about it, reminisce about old times, cry about the memories. In the end they're just memories, but I think they're the most precious thing I have right now. 

I also can't help but feeling as if everyone else has moved on with their lives, but I'm a bit stuck in the past. 

So the question is, how the hell do I even start at this? Do I just walk around acting all friendly (although honestly I feel like a fool and an imposter doing so)? And if I find that person who I feel something of a connection to, what do I do then? Usually at this point, I run away as fast as humanly possible, or at least behave awkwardly enough for them to be put off. 

And to not run away seems to go against every nerve in my body. I never understood socializing, was never a socialite, but still I miraculously am understanding it less and less as time goes on.

Not suicidal (yay!).  Haven't had serious suicidal thoughts since having kids close to a decade ago.  The urge to take care of them has been vital to me.  So I'm instantly better off than I was a decade plus ago.

Right now, just sort of lonely, restless, depressed.

Normally I'd watch a documentary or listen to music to soothe my restless, self-destructive mind.

But that's not working right now...  So here I am.  To talk, I guess.  Anyone else bored?

For 15-20 years, I hated myself endlessly.  I'd smack, punch, cut myself daily.  I'd take drugs and alcohol at overdose levels, hoping for an ""accidental"" death.  I had a ready-to-go noose in my car at all times, for when the mood struck me.

As restless and depressed as I am feeling right now, it's so refreshing that I've gotten past that time of my life where I'd punch myself in the face until I looked mugged, or dripped arm blood all over my floor.

I hope you all know, that if you hold out and wait it out...  You can get better.

I am NOT 100% healthy.  I am still self-destructive in many ways and I need help and treatment...  STAT...

But I'm not suicidal anymore and it's so refreshing.

Just sluggish with zero energy and no matter what I do, I can’t get rid of it. And I hate it. It has ruined so many great opportunities and relationships. Most of all, I feel it has taken my bond with my son away. 

He was just entering pre-adolescence when it started and he needed me, but I was too busy being dead in my room (much more functional now)not having any energy or motivation to play or interact with him like I used to. Not as many outings, camping trips, or vacations like it used to be. There’s some, tho. There is so much dad guilt here cause I feel like it took these years away from us, I feel like it still is and I’m falling apart while I’m trying my hardest. I am not strong anymore, but at least I hope he thinks I am. Prior to the onset (November 2016, it changed my life that much that I remember the month and year) we had a bond that only a son and a father can have. I was a great dad. After it began, it started to affect my personality, my son knew, and after so long, he told me he missed me. He felt that bond breaking, too. 

During this battle with depression, I just feel irritable, like I don’t have any patience for him. I try to be there emotionally for him, but I’m struggling with it, when I have always told him how important it is to express his emotions.

i am plagued by eternal boredom, though this has only been around for the past month. i am so bored, all the time, it hurts. in response to this boredom, I eat. i eat even when im not hungry, and it hurts. people suggest that maybe im having a growth spurt, but I don't know.   
my school is homophobic, claiming to be Christian, but not \*really\* following Christian values. im disgusted with it. i cant survive in this community. we're trying to move schools, but what if I don't fit in at this new one? what if im bullied for being trans?   
i am certainly eager to try this new school, because I have protection as a trans student, and I have another shot at making friends. but right now, im in this gross limbo, where I feel like im going to fail school, be alone, and never advance forward. im so bored with my life. nothing happens. im tired. im so tired all the time. i think im chronically fatigued. i want my life to change. but I don't know how. how do I do this? does anyone have any advice? please? im begging you.",my life is screwed,1

I've spent so many hours job hunting, studying how to effectively job hunt, reaching out to connections, tweaking my resume, writing cover letters, responding to recruiters, looking up industry conventions before COVID, researching companies, and most exhausting of all: putting on a neurotypical face for zoom interview after zoom interview.  

The worst part is that getting an offer doesn't even make me feel better.  It makes me think about all the things I might be closing myself off to as a result of taking an offer.  Not applying to any graduate programs (did I even think I would?).  Not seeing through the other applications I am in the middle of interviewing for (do I want those more?  do I have a chance of an offer there?).  My mind tortures me with all the things I forfeit by acting on a decision.  Not focusing on what I am obtaining for myself, but on the opportunity cost that exists with every choice.  I hate it.

I just want to cry and be held.  I saw a post on this sub yesterday about life requiring so much effort put in for so little enjoyment.  I couldn't agree more.  The world seems to be built for people that get enjoyment from fancy meals, alcohol, luxury cars, expensive clothes, and social media.  None of those things bring me enjoyment, none of those things make my life feel like it's worth living.  If the trappings of excess don't do anything for me, what incentive should I have for sacrificing my time, energy, and health to grind away at a high paying job?  

I just want peace.  I just want stability.  Forget all the noise, forget all the toys.  All of the most blissful moments of my life have been moments of calm and stillness.  Of course I need the foundations of Maslow's pyramid (water, shelter, food, basic clothing, community).  But since when did status become so important as to compromise the foundational needs?  I want to earn my needs being met and to have the rest of my life belong to me, to be used for whatever brings me peace.",Just want to cry and be held,1

Ever since Covid has had us in lockdown, it has been bad for me, i have gained even more weight, have no purpose in life other than play PC games all day, and while that may bring me smiles and a good time temporarily, i am left with emptiness that never goes away.

521,"Hi all, first time posting. I really need to just tell someone that I feel empty inside and I don't know if this is just how I feel depression. For probably a year nothing makes me happy anymore. Maybe a like will make me laugh for a second sure,  but life just doesn't seem satisfying anymore. It's been a weird year for all of us but I should have reasons to be happy; I bought a house, moved in with my partner, have a great career, I'm financially stable; but still....nothing. 

Most days I feel like a robot, just going through the motions like a normal human should. Wake up, go to work, make dinner, watch tv, repeat. My partner says ""I love you"" and I respond ""I love you too"" but there's no feeling behind those words.

This emptiness has started to turn into a kind of anger/frustration. I've though of hurting myself or the ones I love just to feel something. Thankfully I haven't acted on those feelings. In all I'm just very confused. I'm stuck on how to tell my partner that I need help or if they can even find a way to help me? Am I the one that just has to help myself?","I just feel empty, hollow",1
522,"⚠️TW: Talks of self harm⚠️

I’m tired. Tired of trying. Tired of not fitting in and being perfect. I’m tired of being fat and ugly. I’m tired of being dumb. I’m tired of being compared. I’m tired of people not caring. I’m tired of people leaving me. I’m tired of being ignored. I’m tired of stress. I’m tired from being me. Why couldn’t I be someone else? I’m so fucking tired. I relapsed after being over a year self harm free. I am an awful person who is so goddam selfish.

One single cut, one fucking cut is what brought me here. I did it to feel a different kind of pain, the pain that I live with daily is suffocating me.

Any ounce of confidence that I had has been shattered. I keep making these stupid mistakes over and over. I feel like I’m drowning with no air in sight. The workload piled on my back feels unbearable, I keep trying to avoid it. All that it is doing is pushing me deeper down. all the emotions that have been suppressed are forcing their way back up. they are crawling and scraping their way out of the deepest darkest depths of my mind. They are screaming at me, they keep yelling that I’m a failure, that I can’t do anything right. I attempt to drown them out, those words are not unfamiliar to me.

537,"Lately I've been growing more complacent. Before I would always wish that things got better, but now I just hope they stay the same. Time feels like it's constantly moving faster, constantly leaking away from me. I'm stuck in a cycle of not accomplishing anything which leads to losing motivation which in turn makes me wallow in my desperation and not do anything productive. I hate who I was but sometimes I equally hate who I've become. I know people say things get easier but do they really? Because what I'm experiencing is that every day more and more tougher problems arise and if you don't deal with them at that moment they just stack with all the problems you already have. It often feels like waves after waves of problems that I haven't dealt with enough so they've gotten to the point where I'm fighting the whole ocean and all I can do is barely stay afloat. Most times I just want to stop trying, stop swimming and let myself sink. There's something comforting about doing that, just letting go, not needing to fight your problems any more. The ocean floor that I contemplate so often while struggling at the surface looks so much more fun. Until fall of this year, I thought that I was slowly but surely swimming better and better, I thought that I was growing as a person. But, recently I realized that my floaties were actually cement bricks tied to my feet and are dragging me down. The substances that brought me insight, calm and comfort a couple years ago when I hated the world turned out to be clouding my thoughts and the only thing real they brought was comfort. A comfort as real as a mother's embrace but that fades away as soon as the chemicals leave your body only leaving you worse and longing for more comfort than before. I'm getting worse. I gradually abuse more and more drugs, recently I have gone weeks with abusing multiple drugs a day. Today I wished I never existed and I don't even know if I actually think that or it's just the lack of drugs iny system talking. I don't know if I actually hate myself or it's just the chemical imbalances in my brain right now. One thing I do know is that I hated myself way before I took drugs and for a while they actually made that hatred vanish but, right now, I feel as if it creeps back up on me from time to time.",Life's hard,1

539,"This is my first post in this subreddit and honestly the first time I've opened up about this really. I often find myself unsatisfied a lot with some periods of relative joy. I often look back on life with rose-tinted glasses and tend to exaggerate the happier times when I know the reality is that iI'm often more lost, confused and angry than I am content or happy. I have some friends but I often lack the motivation to really do anything and our relationship aren't as close as I've had in the past. It could also do with the fact that I'm a student and I currently don't have a stable source of income that would allow me to enjoy the amenities surrounding me. I guess in summary I generally feel like I could be doing better than I am now and the fact that I also don't have anyone that I could truly open up too, that I can talk too about anything makes those hard times even harder. I do sometimes manage to find happiness in some things and in retrospect I desperately cling on too so I don't face reality. I think that reality is that the reason I over-emphasize the good times are because they're so few and that I honestly would be a step closer to ending it if I didn't. I never realized that I did it until now and I don't know how to deal with it because whenever I find the strength to try to do anything that can change it, one setback is all it takes to put me down.

I'm a junior in college and for the last 8 months, I feel like I've lost all joy in life and really don't see any end in sight. I guess it really started once the world went into lockdown due to COVID-19. I just finished my sophomore year, another great semester grade-wise. I actually just transferred into this new college and was enjoying it so far. Didn't really have that many friends but my roommates were cool and I met a few people to casually talk to.  Once COVID hit, we were sent home from college to sociallly distance. A few months pass and out of nowhere my mother gets it. For two weeks her condition gets worse and worse to the point where she's on the brink of death. In those two weeks, I essentially am by her bed 24/7 assisting her with every action she does. I don't think twice about it, she's my mother and I love her to death, but her condition got even worse. After rushing her to a hospital a second time (cause the first time they told her to go home after 5 mins) she stays there for 3 weeks. In the meantime, my father who lives in another state is taking flights every other day to check up on my brother and I and then back to work. During this time I was under the most stress I've ever been through. 2 weeks in her doctor says she probably won't make it, so you can imagine me there, but she does pull through. It's been a few months and she's back to normal, but I don't think I got over that yet mentally. I still think about it and it's caused me to lose alot of motivation in life, my school work has suffered from being an A student to really a C+ to B- student and now I'm questioning my career choices and major. I used to exercise everyday and now have stopped and started getting anxiety attacks. On top of that, I'm seeing all my peers land jobs and great internships while I'm struggling to get even 1 from anyone even though I'm more qualified. It's all piling up on me and while I left out alot of detail I really hate waking up every morning and I don't know what to do moving forward.

560,"Hey guys, I [24M] just wanted to come here to say that I’ve been very depressed for a long time and I just need a place to talk it out. My depression involves a breakup with a girl I’ll call “C”, and my stresses about my current situation.

The break up took place about a few weeks before I moved back from college. I’ve been insanely sad about it since, and it’s been really hard to deal with. I loved this girl so fucking much, and I honestly never knew what it felt like to be 100% comfortable with someone in a relationship. We hung out nearly every other day since we would be on-campus most of the time. And she was honestly the sweetest person to me, and made me feel so loved. I got to meet her family and they were insanely welcoming (even her cute pup). Being with her was like having a happiness handicap to every day, as if I was automatically happy and ready for the day when she would send me a snap or text me.

I was a senior at my UC and she was a sophomore, so eventually the talk about me leaving eventually came up a few weeks before I left, and we ended up just ending it there. 

(Editing in here after re-reading: I’ve always been insanely anxious about my future, and the thought of me being with an insanely lovely girl and not having any job prospects terrified me. I imagined staying with her at her parents place until I found a job or getting an apartment with her and moving in together, but I had no money. I was so incredibly stressed about merely saving my own ass, I was terrified of having to save her ass too, and how horrible it would be if I couldn’t. Like imagine not being able to buy her a ring? In my mind, I feel absolutely horrible. I’ve always had the mindset of “When an airplane is going down, place the mask over yourself before others.” And being worried about my own damn “mask” while also being worried about hers or a potential family from us put me into major fight or flight zone. All of the anxiety and insecurity that lead to us breaking up instead of me fighting to stay with her and stay near the university, was what inspired me to go to therapy.)

We knew it was best to end it on a good note and I took a hard stance on not having a long-distance relationship, since that would drive my anxiety through the roof, and she agreed. It was heartbreaking, but I tried to remain strong and tried to look to the future. Hoping that what I’ve learned from her and our relationship was something I could confidently take into my next.

I was so wrong. I tried dating after her, and it was bleh and toxic. The next girl I dated was hung up on her ex, and tried to make me jealous for literally no reason. I ended up ending things with her, and that was when it sunk in that I felt like I was never going to be with someone who made me so comfortable again. I understand that there’s “plenty of fish in the sea,” but I’ve dated a lot of girls and my relationships never came close to what I shared with C.

Now, I’ve been experiencing the worst depression for almost a year. I always wish before I go to bed that I would somehow wake up back in bed with her in my old apartment. It’s just honestly a nightmare for me now.

And since it’s been a year, she’s doing very well. She has a well paying job, still going to university, joined a sorority where she made tons of friends, and now... has a new boyfriend worth posting about. I’m just completely devastated and depressed. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy that she is successful and happy. I wouldn’t want to live in a timeline where she wasn’t successful and happy.

But here I am: out of university, jobless, missing an ex that’s over me, and now... no friends. I feel like a complete fucking loser... fuck it, I am a complete fucking loser living with his mom.

And again, don’t get me wrong, I’m trying so fucking hard not be this way, to get over her, to get a job, and to be happy, but it’s just... it’s so hard. I really loved her and getting a job isn’t easy. Happiness isn’t that easy either when you’re looking in the mirror telling yourself you’re a loser. But again, I’m trying. I’m trying to build a mobile app to present to companies to get hired, I’m trying to constantly “put myself back out there,” and I’m currently seeing a therapist about my happiness. But fuck man it’s so hard.

It’s hard knowing I had someone so close to me, someone who loved me so much, and so secure, just gone. Gone forever. We’ve talked, but it’s not the same, and it’s not how it used to be. Whatever flame was there was extinguished and now I’m just here sulking in the memories. I still have her damn cards, the photos of her, and all the texts. I can’t get rid of them, I keep holding on to this strand of “maybe we’re destined to meet in the future and I can show her all the memories again.” Which is just... so dumb of me.

And I wish I could just get this off my chest to my friends, but no matter how many times I say it, it’s still there. And the same goes with telling my therapist. So that’s why I’m here. I figure if I just keep venting about my depression, it’ll go away. It’s good to get stuff out. It just doesn’t really help.

Anyway, that’s my story right now. Thanks for taking the time to read my vent.",I’ve been going to sleep every night for the last year wishing I would wake up 580 days prior to today,1

563,"All I'd done for the past year and a half or so is just lay around. I just stare a screen, try to sleep, and look at walls. I then made social media a year ago and starting posting, messaging and sharing, and became a social media addict. I've deleted my accounts now but it's so embarrassing and no matter what, I will have always wasted my youth doing that.

I've had a very horrific past, with severe physical abuse, bullying, neglect, watching my mom die of an OD when I was 16, being in a physically/emotionally/mildly sexually relationship for 4 years, being sexually assaulted over the summer, etc.

I'm halfway through college and have work experience and just quit a job but I can't feel that I'm wasted my youth. I am a constant anxious wreck, I'm severely depressed and lazy, I have no drive, no friends and no hobbies. I had a bad therapist and an unqualified school one and am seeing a new one on Wednesday, who I will then see weekly until 2021.

My problem is that I feel I have reached the point of no return and I will never be successful.

I am undisciplined. I do not have good character, do not know what I want to do with my life, do not follow a diet, do not get out of bed most days. My depression manifests itself in the past tormenting me and the world around me stabbing at me. My anxiety makes everything feel impossible, the future a guaranteed worse place than even here, and being a failure at 30 year old. My OCD causes me to think I'm a horrible person, think I should have done so much more and be so much more - basically considering myself the worst possible ""parallel universe"" of myself. My PTSD makes me think I will never be a normal human being and my traumas will never not define me.

I need help. This is suffering. I am getting older, I want to change, I want to be happy, I want to use my smarts and writing talents to graduate college and enjoy a career I love and possibly have a family and forget about this tough, trying period of my life.

When I try to express that him constantly talking for me about my problems and such makes it harder he says I need to get into his world, because we already have so little in common. He’s all I have. I put so much effort into trying to find happiness from his. Recently we’ve argued more and more. I know he struggles too, and the internet is his way to be himself without dealing with the physical appearance problems. He can be himself, and I respect that. When he struggles I try to help, but I keep falling short. This past time I actually made him more upset and we didn’t speak for over a week. I would go online, just to make sure he was ok, and he never said a word to me. I asked to join him once and he said it was busy at the time. Three hours later he never said anything so I just left. Tonight I went on, just to look for skins and he asked me to come meet someone he’s known there for about a year now. I just wanted to be invited to try and talk with him a little. We didn’t even say hi or bye, barely acknowledged me. I spent three hours with one of his friends because he was kind enough not to leave me alone. I feel like I could just stop talking altogether and it wouldn’t be missed. He doesn’t need me. He can make friends with ease online. I’m a relic of his past. What a stupid thing to be depressed about I’m sure, but at this point, I feel like I’m alone again. Like there’s no one left. I feel like the asshole, like I’m problematic for everyone else who tolerates me. Maybe he sees the same problems with me everyone else did, or he’s finally realizing that they are bothering him.

Tldr; i am depressed, my friend is depressed. They remind me why i am and i dont know if being friends is more helpful or hurtful for us both.

I am 23 F and i have a friend who is 24 M. We live in separate states and we both suffer with depression.  We met a couple months ago through a game and we became pretty close. We were both upfront about our mental health. He is alot more vocal than me about telling me when he isnt feeling 100%, i try my best to be positive but i have lots of hard times even thinking what would make me feel better in the situation. I try my best to feel supportive and not over bearing or cheesy, but i feel it just annoys him. 

We talk almost everyday, at the very least a ""hope you have a good day"" or ""i hope you sleep well"". We have gotten very close, while not entering a relationship (for both of our sakes). I feel i am one of the few people he confides in. I dont want to stop him from expressing when he is struggling, but i find myself spiraling sometimes because of it. The last couple years i have been really trying to work on myself and put thoughts out of my head and i feel i am taking steps backwards having been reminded of it all. I feel completely useless and sometimes the downs from a single chat take a bit to recover from. I dont know how to even be more vocal to him about when i am feeling like shit, it has really just always been something ive kept inside and i want to feel more able to talk to him about it but i worry that would probably be burdening, so i try my best to be the optimist. Which generally frustrates me bc i am not good at thinking or talking.

I could go on and on but the real deal is that i dont know if i am actually helping him, not that i think i can cure his depression but i dont know if he wants to try either. I would like to think that ending the friendship would be good for me but ive made alot of friends from him that i would be worried about stepping on toes, and i dont want him to feel more burdened than i know he feels. I really care for him, and i know it would hurt alot to lose this friendship, but would it be better in the long run for me or even both of us? I just would feel incredibly guilty and selfish if i did. He is one of the few people i feel really comfortable with, and he has definitely made me feel more cared for than anybody i have known, and i dont think it is just infatuation.  The whole situation makes me feel useless.

569,"I'll start by saying I have very little formal self-care knowledge.  My family did not talk about emotions or managing mental health.  I have not read self-help books or internalized lectures on self-care strategies.  I haven't had more than a few therapy sessions (for reasons we all know therapy to be an absolute pain).  So, this is probably abundantly obvious to some, but I was going on a walk today and had the idea that it might help me deal with some of my issues and/or get closure if I were to imagine writing a letter to my past self (at 18 y.o. in my case because I feel like that's when I could have benefitted most from what I have learned in the past 6 years or so).  

I would want to say a few things.  I would want to stress that even when life becomes extremely unpleasant and challenging and discouraging, it is still possible to make it back to normal or even happiness by enduring through the bad.  I would want to convey with certainty that I could in fact change my major and pursue a different direction.  I am smart enough, I could study well enough, I could make it so worthwhile in the end.  I would want to provide lots of assurance that while I should be nice to others and build connections with peers, I should also fully know and remind myself often that I am entirely good enough even without anyone lusting for my body, or wanting to be my SO, or any other kind of external validation.  There's probably more that I'd want to write as well but those are the things that came to mind when I got the idea that it could be a helpful thing.

I've had mild social anxiety most of my life, nothing that has controlled me, but after this breakup, I can't even look my parents in the eyes. It's been about 8 months, and i'm doing much better and improving every day. Unfortunately, the timing that I'm going through this is not great. I just transferred to a new university in the middle of a pandemic where I know almost no one except my roommate and his friends. I've met some new people and even been on a couple dates, but my self esteem is so low that I can't convince myself that they genuinely like me despite having every shred of evidence to believe so. 

Im seeing a therapist and considering medication. Im doing all the work I need to get past this extremely difficult chapter of my life. Reading, journaling, exercising daily, meditating; anything you'd read in a self help book, I'm trying it.

I believe my core problem is being able to identify that im struggling with self esteem and social anxiety, and feeling absolutely worthless because of it. Every day I see guys my age who radiate the stereotypical dude bro energy; and while I have nothing against that, I feel incredibly inferior when comparing myself to them. I have never been a very masculine guy. I like music, painting, hiking, cooking and reading a good book after a walk in the park. Im very in touch with my emotions and consider myself an empath. I like all of these things about myself, but cant help but think others would see these things as off putting. My conversations are never about football, the weather, or that great tv show i saw last night, I always end up going back to philosophy, politics, life stories and lessons, and general meaningful topics, things that a typically masculine guy would not care about. I guess im stuck with the mindset that because i'm not super masculine and I rely on my feelings a lot that im inferior. These feelings of inferiority feed into my social anxiety which feeds directly back into my feelings of inferiority. It's a vicious cycle, one i'm not sure how to break.

This is my first relationship, but its ending like all my friendships, I'm so stupid, aren't I, to think I could be happy. I've always ended up alone. I was told to treat others nicely, I was never told that they'd abuse my kindness and throw me out, I'm used and once they can't use me anymore, they go... looking back on everyone I've known, none of them were really friends with me, not really, only a couple actually cared, now the last one is leaving...

Her friends claimed to be my friends. But they never really were. Whenever we would have a little argument they would come swooping in to her side and never hear me out. In the moment she announces that my no longer together, Like I know she will, they'll all come swooping to her to comfort her while the same time being assholes to me like they always are. 

Even now all of this has happened, is happening, and will continue to happen, I can't cry, I can't be sad, all I can do is smile, smile and be sad. I want to let it all out but I can't. I'm a guy, I'm supposed to be strong, supposed to push through the pain. Not allowed to get upset. I get told that by everyone, I'm not allowed to express my emotions, I'm not allowed to talk about my feelings. 

I'm so fucking sick and tired of this life, I just wanna end it. I want to cancel my subscription to life...

I'm not allowed to cry and let it out, so why should I let it bottle up more? Why shouldn't I just kill myself, people forget about my existence all the time, what'll it matter if I just end it... people move on, its a fact of being alive, so why should I continue to exist if I'm just going to get teased, bullied, and heartbroken... I didn't plan on being alive much longer anyways. lol, I was going to enlist and fight for my country, and make my death mean something, but I guess I won't get the chance...

Hey, if you've made it this far, I'm sorry you had to read that... I'll try not to bother the people of this subreddit anymore with my depressing rants...

592,"I'm a first-year graduate student and entering my new university in the pandemic has turned what I believe to be my moderate dysthmia (undiagnosed, cyclic depression) into a severe depressive episode. I am constantly working or trying to muster the focus to work on my classes and research. The only human I talk to in person is my boyfriend who I just moved in with a couple of months ago and who I'm going long distance with in a month or so (another thing making me depressed). Pre-COVID, I finally got good enough at managing my depression by making myself go out, having a part-time retail job with school, and having hobbies. Now I feel like I am constantly playing catch-up with work even though it's all I do, and all my remedies are out the window. I feel like I don't even have time to cry so I constantly swallow it and resume whatever I was doing. Sometimes I can't, and then it puts me further behind. I feel guilty for constantly using mental health as an excuse for me to not work as hard as I used to. I used to have the ""constantly empty"" kind of depression and it's scaring me that I am experiencing the crying kind. One little, slightly snippy email from my research advisor today completely crushed me and ruined what might have actually been an okay day. There's much more to what's stressing me right now (family, etc.) but the point is it is all too much, and even when I take a break I don't find enjoyment.

I have a first appointment with a therapist tomorrow. I've had therapy before and I'm feel like getting an appointment was being thrown a life ring. I also have an exam tomorrow but I can't focus on studying right now because I keep wanting to cry and I keep thinking about how to fit all of my problems into one one-hour session.

I know everyone is struggling with the pandemic but my professors do not seem understanding. I just wish everyone would cut everyone a little more slack. I immediately told my students that reached out with even the slightest COVID concerns (got sick, poor mental health, family sick) that they don't have deadlines for the rest of the semester and to do things at their pace. I've never sent a snippy email to my students and I wish everyone would just practice a little more patience.",DAE feel like they don't have time to break down,1

I tried to look up plans myself but they either don't cover what I need at an affordable price or cost 200 dollars or more. My father has heath insurance but he refused to put me in his plan, even though it only costs 100 dollars a month. I tried to tell him that I'll pay him back but he still says no. I need help, I know I need to go to the hospital or talk to a therapist but I can't afford it. I can't even afford my own antidepressants. I feel so stuck and helpless. I hate this.

594,"Like I don't know how much more unlucky my life can get. I grew up with a single mom until she married a psychopath that i had to live with between 8th grade and 11th grade (they were still married but I managed to get him out of the house I was living in). Then I was told the second I graduate high school he's coming back and it's a very long story but it's actually better to live on the streets than to live in a house with someone as delusional as that person.

Because of that, I'm dorming in college.... online college... during a pandemic... wasting 20k this year instead of just staying at home which I can't do. Not only that, the regulations here don't allow you to do anything to meet any new people and even if you do meet people there's literally nothing you can do because people act like everyone else is going to kill you if you get closer than 6 feet to them without a mask. The people that make these decisions don't even think that mental health is anything to worry about at all. Idk about anyone else but I'd rather have good mental health and bad physical health than the other way around (yes, including literally dying).

I just feel completely alone. I'm hundreds of miles away from any family and previous friends and like I don't see anything I can possibly to do get out of this hole.

And that which we had built, 
Came crashing down. 

1 month since you departed, I couldn't comprehend what had happened. I do not know, for, everytime I attempt to wrap my head around it, I get lost beyond comprehension.
It was long, it was hard, 
The first month without you my love, 
You were gone, without a trace,

Two months since you departed, 
The toughness of my skin began to increase,
Life was getting better, despite your departure,
Abandoned I was, but not alone, 
As this was merely social,
Alone, I was in my head,
For no one was there to hold, the bed lay cold, 
And empty; 
Things were getting better. 

Three months since you departed,
You kept contacting me, talking about things, 
I thought we could make it work. 
The pain was merely getting started, 
For you tore that one up too,
Despite my horrible bursts of pain,
Echoing from the deepest parts of my soul.
It was getting easier,
The skin was tougher,
Nonetheless it slowly began to cease being that way, 
For my heart grew more and more desperate for your touch,
To feel your warm embrace. 
To just be held, loved by you once more,
As I had once been... 

Four months since you departed, 
I can feel the emotion, 
Raw emotion, it courses through my veins,
I miss you my love, I cannot bear this much longer,
For every night, every day, 
I'd still hold you, to make you comfy,
Feel loved, safe in the knowledge that you are so.
Every night, every day,
No matter the pain,
No matter the suffering
I'd still hold you 
Maybe one day you'll gain
A grasp of how I feel,
Maybe someday... 

Perhaps one day this will end, 
Or maybe it'll outlive me.
Maybe it's all this way,
To be worth it in the end,
I don't know,
All I do know,
Is that I need you,
My sweet sweet choo,
I can't do this much more.

623,"Hello everyone, 

I just need to write down how I feel somewhere. I tried talking with my best friend but even though he listened he just didnt understand.

# tl,dr: My girlfriend left in february. I'm broken inside, failing school, not seeing friends due to lockdown and crying myself to sleep every night

For 2 years I've had a massive crush on a girl. We became best friends, like, BEST FRIENDS EVER, talking 24/24, going out to the cinema, bowling, clubs etc etc together. Of course we ended up together and when we moved to the big college we took a flat together. I had good grades, my internships were really pleasant. Life was perfect. 

Everyday I'd wake up seeing her face and telling her how much I love her, and every night I'd kiss her goodbye. She would come to bed and kiss me when she was leaving to school, I would bring her flowers or chocolate at least once a week. Every night we watched some series on Netflix or Amazon Prime. We would go to new places every week end, party with friends every now and then. She was my world, my everything. I loved her and she loved me, we were happy, always laughing, never ever did we have a fight in the 16 months we lived together before 2020 started.

Early this year she became more and more distant. No more morning kiss before leaving. No more sex. No more TV together cuddling in the sofa. I assumed it would go away once her exams were over. She wasn't a good student and had a lot of troubles learning, so she would spend 7 hours a day reading her notes. At first I tried to help her study but it was obvious she wasnt meant to go to college and she would often end up crying after 2 hours of not being able to answer my questions. 

 At some point I stopped helping and decided to watch TV or play some video games while she was studying. We started fighting, mostly because her spending the night studying meant that I was too noisy doing anything but reading a book in silence in the bed. Playing some video games with my friends on Discord would lead to massive outburst of anger from her. 

Shit hit the fan in february, during the holidays. Our parents dont live close so we didnt see each other for two weeks. It's carnival season in the North of France so she would go to events every day while I was at home, not liking this type of events. We wouldnt speak a lot cause she was busy partying in huge crowds, and our conversations were just ""did you have fun? yeah"" or something like that. End of the holidays we come back home. True story I was buying hotel rooms in Berlin for our 2 years birthday that was 15 days after, and while I'm looking at planes to go there she comes to me crying and says: 

**""I don't love you anymore""**

To go back a decade early I was the bullied kid. I found a girlfriend when I was 14, we had a toxic abusive realtionship where she cheated on me a lot of times and after 5 years of intense pain for me she left and said she never loved me. I tried to commit suicid and dropped out of everything, missed my exams to become a policeman and gained 35 kilos. 

With my girlfriend I found friendship first, then love, and I had the best years of my life. She was the person who, even without knowing, helped me get out of my depression. She was a living sunshine, making me happy everyday for years. I loved her so much. Even when she became distant I still loved her like a madman. And this girl who was everything to me had no feelings for me anymore. She packed her things and left the morning after. Lockdown started on this very evening, so we couldnt see each other for 2 months. I tried to fix it, wanted to go talk to her as soon as it was possible, but a month after she left she told me she had someone else and that she wouldn't talk to me again. She deleted me from all social medias and I never saw her again. 

After the lockdown I went back to my flat cause I had an internship in Lille. Going back there lead to a massive depression. Out of 70 days of internship, 30 were me crying on my desk with shaking hands making me unable to work, and 4 \* 5 days at home due to the doctor putting me in sick leave. Of course I had a negative review from my employer, which will severely hurt my chances to get in good jobs next year. My school grade average went from 14 in december 2019 to 7 at the moment, I missed more classes in a month than in the last 4 years combined. As we are once again in lockdown I moved out of the flat and I'm now back to my mother's 5 years after going away from home. 

I have the opportunity to spend a year in Canada to get a MBA there in partnership with my college. I thought it would be a fresh start. But no, due to COVID all the classes from january to may will be online, and my french college won't let us go to Canada until COVID is over. So I'll end up at my mom's home, attending online classes with a 6 hours jet lag meaning living in the afternoon/nights and sleeping during the morning. 

 It's been 9 months. My school grade average went from 14 in december 2019 to 7 at the moment, I missed more classes in a month than in the last 4 years combined. As we are once again in lockdown I moved out of the flat and I'm now back to my mother's 5 years after going away from home. 

I'm broken inside. I have no motivation for school and it's probably too late to fix my semester. I have no motivation to work out and I went from 75 to 87 kilos in 4 months. We're under lockdown so I can't see my friends, in fact I have not seen anyone but my mom for the past 4 weeks. My life is just me waking up exhausted, browsing reddit and youtube, playing some games, then going to sleep exhausted crying myself to sleep. 

Perhaps the worst is the feeling I get when I think about her. I still love her, I do miss her. I wonder how I could not see her feelings dying, what I did to make her feelings die and I'm afraid of falling in love again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've had a pretty shitty life, I lost thousands of savings in my first relationship, lost all my long term bestfriends, got bullied my from 7 to 18, haven't spoken to my father for 3 years due to his alcoholism and have a crippling addiction to video games. **But what really kills me is hearing a voice in my head 24/24 saying ""I don't love you anymore""**

624,"Hi, I'm a 25/f  and over the last year and a few months my mental health has taken a big nose dive.  
I'll just come right out with a few things because i'm very sad and I like to talk about it.  
I was sexually assaulted by someone very close to me last year and I took it pretty hard.   
Ive always had anxiety and a little depression from my childhood so when I found out that not only did he rape me once, but twice I lost it, I just sat on my couch and starred into my carpet for almost an entire day.. motionless. every night I would cry on my floor, rocking back and fourth. Then just tell myself you're better than this, you have a lot of great things in life, and just get up. I did that and more and more bad things started happening to me. Now today, I found out something from someone that I trusted (which is hard for me to do right now) and I'm at a point where things are getting a little scary for me and I need help. I've done counseling for a few months and really benefitted from it but now i'm thinking I might need medication? Im scarred of medication typically so im just trying to see if anyone can tell me how its possibly helped them? idk :(",Is medication successful for depression?,1

Now that we're quarantined I realized that going to school to have some human interaction was the only thing that kept me a little motivated and happy. Now, I feel worse than ever; I've had my sad moments even when life was normal but quarantine is making it worse. I started skipping online school because I feel too sad and unmotivated to do anything, I feel like a failure. I dont even draw or play my guitar anymore. I don't do anything, I just feel sad. I want to go back to studying but I've missed so many subjects that I don't know what to do anymore. Going to actual school was the thing that kept me motivated on studying and waking up in the morning, but now all i want to do is just lay in bed and cry, because i feel like im a disappointment to my mother who is all alone, my uncle and grandma recently died of covid too.

627,"For these past 2 years studying abroad in Canada, I had a really tough time, well not ""really"" about social interactions or anything actually, but I'm just really really sad, my father has bipolar so I'm starting to connect that this is passed on to me. When social interacting, I consider myself to be the really talkative and friendly type who tries to get along with everyone successfully most of the times (oh and I do have doubt whether people really like me or not, and I'm positive they do since they do enjoy talking to me and most oftenly engages with me, and yes I'm sure this is not out of pity either), this is not forced and it actually brings me a lot of joy, but, to be like this I show no emotions other than being ""happy"" most of the times. At night thats when my mood noticebly dropped, which is when I think about is life worth or not, these suicidal, hopeless thoughts about the future of mine keep playing over and over in my head, even when I tried to shut down my head and sleep (I don't want to die, just want my existence to dissapear), which inturn gives me sleepless days oftenly to the point where I had only 4hrs of sleep or no sleep at all, I oversleep often too (max was 14 hrs, and I need 9 hrs of sleep in order to be awake). The reason why I'm writing this now is because I started crying (little to no tears though) and was hyperventilating when I was doing my schoolwork, basically thinking about the future. I don't think I had any issues growing up, have a good family who cares about me and puts no pressure (though I never talked to my family about my mental state, never talked about this to anyone actually, this is a first time speaking out), have no difficulties in financial nor any disabilities, this made me wonder whether I have the right to be sad or not when looking at other people's hardships. Having read an article stating that if you have suicidal thoughts or hopelessness for 2 weeks, then I should seek help, reading more and more articles about depression made me realize that the symptoms I have currently are not normal. I want to feel the joy of life again, I wan't to end my feeling of hopelessness, I want to picture stuff that is worth living for, but I just can't bring myself to speak to anyone, i really just can't. So I'm trying to find antidepressants pills that would help me, currently looking at fluoxeitne since it's quite cheap comparing to the other pills, and people mentioning it's really effective too, should I buy it and test it? Are there any side effects? Thank you in advance!

633,"i dreamt of my self dying, it was some time ago now, months, i think i cant count days anymore, feels like its all just a really long day

doesn't feel like living, feels much different then that

i died in a hotel room, i was alone

i was watching myself disappear, slowly

and since, im disappearing, but quite fast

&amp;#x200B;

at first i felt fear, shaking, i felt my muscles being tense

i started hearing my every breath 

and with that came the voice

&amp;#x200B;

i watched my self disintegrate, i tried to get out the door,

like that was going to save me

it felt painless at first, but i knew i should run

&amp;#x200B;

i panicked, its here again i thought, and i was scared to deal with it again

i prayed, i begged, if there's something out there, a god,

please don't make me go trough it again

&amp;#x200B;

i felt like i would do anything to stop it

&amp;#x200B;

the pain started to get more intense, i looked down and now

i realised im going away, tiny pieces of myself were in the air,

on the ground, around my self

&amp;#x200B;

the thoughts started to overwhelm me, i needed help

everything changed, i started appreciating the hours of the day i had to be alone, cause i was slipping away, and before long my thoughts would be filled with others

&amp;#x200B;

as i started to run, i reached the door, i opened it

and there i was, standing in the hallway

i was looking at me

i just wanted it to stop

&amp;#x200B;

i resisted it, the thoughts, the voice, the imagionary world of mine

i called my friends

but the thing is, rejection felt harsher then,

it pushed me in

&amp;#x200B;

i switched with her, and now i was watching myself from outside

i still felt the pain

i wanted to bite my hand so i wouldnt screem

and then i woke up

&amp;#x200B;

i started doubting everything about me, who are you really

&amp;#x200B;

i tried, i tried too hard i think, the harder i tried to

stay well the more i felt i was horrible at everything

&amp;#x200B;

i made awkward conversations with my friends

i felt like a joke, and i was

they didnt want me there i thought, i dont even talk, and when

i do, i fuck up, 

would it be different if i wasnt here?

&amp;#x200B;

i knew if i drifted away from people, it would hurt me even more

so i tried, and tried, and tried

&amp;#x200B;

i remember taking up a book and learning the 

sentences, reading them out loud, so i wouldn't lose it again

i thought if i learned, if i made my self learn anything, 

maybe i could keep my mind 

&amp;#x200B;

but i couldnt

my attention span grew shorter by day

i would zone out, i lost track of time

&amp;#x200B;

and there i was, back inside my inner world

infront of me, a room, the same room for years 

its funny to think about it

people have the power to imaginate great, impossible places

and i put my self inside a room, low ceiling, tiny room, 

crowded with people, my audience

&amp;#x200B;

theres the judge, sitting in front of me

i gave him a face, and i gave them a face

i made them, but they are far from people

they feel cold, distant, but its the best i have

&amp;#x200B;

i started shuting down the real world

ashamed of myself, my words, the way i move, the way

i dress, the way i feel towards other people

&amp;#x200B;

i felt envy

jealous of their lives

happiness

i became a shell

&amp;#x200B;

everything was gone, so again, i ask, who are you really

i dont know my self

&amp;#x200B;

back to my inner world, because there is some comfort there

its a face, and i havent seen a face in a while

&amp;#x200B;

i measure what i say

i think about it before playing it out in my head

i wouldnt let myself be human, not even in my imagination

&amp;#x200B;

the more i go the more lonely i get

&amp;#x200B;

i spoke to someone, finally

i felt relieved

cried for hours

they said they understood

they said its okay to look for help

they said its normal

&amp;#x200B;

but then

&amp;#x200B;

they said i was dramatic

they said i was too spoiled

they said i could do it my self, i didnt need a therapist

&amp;#x200B;

and guess what stuck with me

&amp;#x200B;

so i said i was better

like i could do it 

i didnt want to be a burden,

but at the same time i wanted to scream

because they were the only people i had left

&amp;#x200B;

so im here again, in the room

My girlfriend (26) of 2.5 years got sick of it and left me 3 days ago because of my depression when she caused most of it by cheating on me and guilting me into taking her back by saying she was going to hurt herself. 

She said she loved me but she was cheating 5 months into our relationship and I caught her, she told me to fuck off and kill myself when she thought she found her forever but he used her. 

She wanted me to take her back after that and I did because I was alone. 

Being tired, antisocial and mentally broken made her not love me even though she said she’d be there for me.

She said hurtful things and called me damaged  and left saying she couldn’t take it anymore. She’s right.

We made so many plans for our future. All gone because of me. I screw everything up

I eventually ended up prolonging my studies by a year in order to finish up the rest of my exams, and write my thesis.

Let me explain.
For the past 6 years, after my parent’s divorce, I’ve barely felt anything. I think this is because I repressed the emotions and the trauma. Lately, it’s been getting really bad and I’ve been thinking about how I feel like everything is worthless. One thing that really uplifted me during the past year was the YouTube channel Unus Annus (the concept of the channel is that Markiplier and his friend Ethan/ crankgameplays would upload daily to YouTube for a year and then delete the channel and every trace of it at the end of the year) and now that it’s over, I feel like I have nothing to live for, if I could be so morbid. 
I also find lots of comfort in the rare occasion when I’m upset or angry, because I don’t feel upset or angry barely ever. I cried for the first time in months yesterday. My s/o asks me how I’m feeling and I always reply “I don’t know” because I really don’t know. 
I really like when I’m in this empty state, because it’s so familiar and has always been there. It keeps me from becoming too overjoyed or too angry. That might have to do with trying to take control of things I have no control over.

658,"We’ve all probably seen the memes about how our regular depression and our quarantine depression are now meeting up with our seasonal depression. That’s mixing with college depression for me too. Felt super motivated in the beginning of the term. Then started feeling unmotivated, which was made worse by having my wisdom teeth removed resulting in my inability to focus on anything for a week due to pain and being high on pain meds. That made everything so hard and now I just wish I could drop out with no consequences for my GPA. I just want to go to school in person. This is so bad for my mental health.

Im 17 now. I dropped out of school a year ago, got my heart broken and my self image shattered, torn away from friends and have been isolated inside my house for a year and half.

Clearly. Things didnt work out how i wanted. But thats something ive come to terms with. I live in the podunk hick filled backwoods of Canada. All kids here care about is booze and sex. I just wanted to live in city where there would be a diverse group of people so i wouldnt be forced to be someone im not.

I like expressing my interests alot, i love writing, music, and just going out to have fun. Yet, lots of people here dont understand what the fuck im doing cause if there isnt any alcohol involved its boring to them. 

I wanna go to college in a different city or hell even different province. Anyway i can just start over really. Where no one knows me and i can present myself how i really am. Not how i fake it here. 

But ive never had a job, or any work experience. I dropped out of school so no education either. Im not dumb, but employers aint gonna hire a 17 year old with no experience around here.

I dont expect life to be handed to me. But just some help would be nice, someone who can get me off my ass. Instead of rotting away inside. Not a girlfriend but someone who i know even if im being a hardass they will force me to do something.

I took my meds once, and in the first hour I had taken it my dissociation got so so much worse and I became so so numb. No feeling at all.

I used to be a student who consistently got 95’s and above but now...It’s just a cycle of missing assignments and late grades. I should be happy at the fact that I even managed to turn them in but....I feel so useless. None of my family and friends understand and it’s truly eating at me.

Last night I was watching an Anime that I really like and I almost finished it but then all of a sudden I got really sad and started thinking about the fact that I’ll never live in an anime life and escape this terrible world to live in an amazing fantasy world in a high school in anime and for some reason I just started crying and now I don’t even want to finish the show because I don’t want to miss the show because at this point I’ve gotten so into the show that the characters seem like my friends and I don’t want to leave them, I did some research and found out that it’s called Post Anime Depression and is a real thing and ik that I have it. Another thing is that I’ve been thinking about things in my past and I’ve been denying that they have every happened is my head because I want to live in a anime world so bad bad I’ve just been so sad. Last night was the first time I cried in years and it was nice but I didn’t want my family to hear me cry because I try to act like mature and responsible and a man in front of them because I’m 16 which means 2 years until I’m an adult and I can move out.

While I'm confident there is NOTHING that can treat ADHD outside of medication, I keep hearing from anti-psychiatry that these drugs will ruin my life and it's making me paranoid, even though it's my first day, they talk about permanent side effects, and other stuff.

I'm wondering how other people deal with this?

Now I'm not a violent person by any means, I will never just randomly hit someone, but I am just angry, not at this random happy person, but at myself, for lacking the means to be like this random-happy-person, I am angry at myself, at my incompetency.

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason why I want to beat the shit out of this random-happy-person, is because in my head, I don't buy this happiness act, how can someone be happy in our society ? with how things are ? I feel like you have to have your head buried in the fucking sand to be happy with how things are, which I guess is contradictory to what I just said above, about me being angry at myself for not being happy, because if being happy means you have to be ignorant of things around you, why would I ever want to be happy ? but hey I never said my emotions made any goddamm sense, if they did make sense, I would probably not be here, writing this shit of a post.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe no one is truly happy in life ? maybe those people that I identify as being happy are struggling just as much as I do, because other people expect them to be happy, because that is the norm, and if you don't appear to be happy or content with your life then something must be fucking wrong with you or something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't say I'm depressed, as in diagnostically depressed, from my understanding of depression, being depressed is not feeling \*anything\*, being void of emotions, but I definitely feel something, I feel frustration, anger, and sadness. Maybe I am depressed ? I don't know really, and at this point, I don't think labels mean very much, all I know is, I'm not content with my life, how it ended up, and where it is currently going, I'm 23 without much going on right now, no drive nor ambition in me. I am extremely pessimistic, I only see the bad in things, and in people. I want to change, to see things differently, but it seems impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

And if you're that happy-random-person walking down the street, although why the fuck would you be here if you were, then don't worry about me pummeling you, it's just a way to express my feelings, and please give me a Manual to life or something, a ""Life for Dummies"" book or something, because I clearly suck at this thing.

I'm a 27yo male with a strange sexuality. When I was around 21, I started to get into to niche pornography. As the years have passed by, I have gone deeper and deeper into the tunnel of this niche pornography, to the point where it has affected every single relationship with women that I've ever tried to have.

Around 6 years ago, I started to have panic attacks. I constantly feel as though I'm inside of a dream. I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I drink, heavily. I have put on 80 lbs. My body aches. I constantly feel as though I need to be alone and safe.

Anyone ever been through something similar? I'm just trying to make something of my life, but my mind and soul cannot believe that I am into this type of pornography. For the past 6 years, my cortisol levels have been off the charts.

I feel like I'm on the road to death by 35...

I have had multiple heart surgeries over eight since I've been alive but hopefully I don't have to have anymore

I have met the love of my life. He is aware of my health issues and makes sure I'm healthy. He assures me he isn't bothered by my limitations and he really doesn't care if I can't have children or if we even adopt. He just wants me. 

I love him I just hate when I know I can't do things that everyone else can. I can't lift heavy things or do a lot of basic work. He loves cooking he wishes he went to culinary school so I don't even do that. I feel so stressed that I'm not doing anything I try to help the best I can and he never shames me for taking breaks when I have to but I just feel so pathetic. I feel like I'm a waste of space and that he'll grow to resent me...

I don't know what else I can do he says that I'm perfect that I care for him emotionally. That I support him more than any of his exes did. He tells me I'm smart and he's in love with me for my mind and heart but I still feel like it's not enough. Like I'm never going to be enough.

I love children I always have I want to work in childcare as a teacher or a social worker it's what I'm going to college for. I keep daydreaming being pregnant and giving him a baby.

688,"I (30F) just got off the phone with my youngest brother (24M). He says he is “just done.” He says he can’t sleep at night because he knows he has to wake up in the morning. He says he has realized how few people care about him. He says he has wasted the last few years of his life. He says there isn’t really anything to do about it. 

The problem is, I am also going through the same thing, for years. I know how he feels, or, better said, I have felt those same feelings. And I’m currently more or less in the same spot he’s in. 

I could, and have offered him the usual (and often helpful) options for him, such as therapy (which he has gone through, as have I) and talking to a family member I have confided in for years (NOT our parents).

He refuses. He gets angry when someone tries to help. I get it. No one understands exactly what you’re going through. Which is why I know I don’t know exactly what he’s going through. But I know that feeling. And I’m still trying to deal with it myself.

How do I convey to him what I truly believe about him? That he is amazing, and a good person, and honestly the smartest person I’ve ever met? How do I tell him that I know the feeling, without unloading on him how I am doing (I will certainly not put knowledge on him.)

How do you convey to someone that they are so amazing and deserve happiness? When you can’t even feel that for yourself. You’re not lying to him. But you hold that last part back? Because you don’t want to put that on him, for one. But, more importantly, you want him to have to hope you definitely don’t have.

I am looking for answers here. Any and all honest ones will mean more to me than you know.

691,"The year was 2006. I won the leading role in my high school play. 

We attended a private high school with a huge, beautiful, velvet-lined auditorium. The stage crew had flyspace and the drama club paid annually for an adult orchestra to accompany us. We were so spoiled. And the bar for talent was unusually high. 

Between my junior and senior year I did an adult community theatre production of “Tommy” by The Who and played the teenage Sally Simpson. That director ended up taking over my high school theatre, and suddenly there was a window for me. 

He replaced the suggested “Into the Woods Junior” with a Rock musical, specifically with me in mind. He handed the music director a CD of the show. It had my name written on it in sharpie. 

I’ll never forget the chilly day in early September, when I had Dad drive me to school as early as possible. I was alone when I found the cast list with my name written, thrillingly, at the top.

I called home right away. Mom freaked out. Then I called Dad at work. I’d never heard them so proud. 

The rest of the day was a blur. I overheard a mean conversation at lunch. A couple people thought I wasn’t hot enough to be a leading lady.

The best part was running into my cast mates and friends in the hall and squealing and jumping up and down. It was a cast of 8 and all seniors. We were a bunch of cool losers and we ran that joint. 

And then during rehearsals, something happened. 

My leading man had an offsite girlfriend, and she was an insecure disaster. So in order to placate her, he started spreading rumors about me. He told people I was gross, I was a bad stage kisser, and started making plans for the others to go out without me. 

I had two friends in the cast that wouldn’t put up with it. They stuck around and waited for me. But it fractured our cast in two. And I was devastated. I was so looking forward to all the cool girl privileges that come with being the leading lady as a senior girl. And this asshole was ruining my life. Even worse, he refused to do his job onstage. He didn’t want to have chemistry with me, didn’t want to look like he was enjoying having to dance and flirt with my character. 

He told one of the other girls he wished she had been cast opposite him instead. I found them all goofing around pretending she was singing my parts. It made me want to quit. 

Our director eventually yelled at him. 

He shrugged it off mostly but he came around and did his job. But as soon as rehearsal was over, he literally ran out of the room. So much for my senior year. Fuck him and all the rest of them.

During cue-to-cue I was singing a solo and they were sitting in the house making fun of me. 

Our show still got rave reviews. We were still a powerhouse senior class with 8 incredible voices that had been eagerly waiting for this chance to shine. 

After the first weekend, the Washington Post came to see the show and ran a photo of me and my leading man. The school pasted a ceiling-to-floor laminated copy on the entrance to the school. It was bigger than I was. 

They left it there until the end of the year. It was pretty surreal. I was mostly just happy it was over.",There was a giant poster of me in the entrance to my high school. And I hated myself and didn’t care.,1
692,"For a long time I mocked the idea of depression. I looked at it as an excuse for someone to make to make them feel better about not doing anything.

Ever since then I’ve taken care of my grandpa that has had 3 types of cancer. Over the past 8 years, from the time I was in middle school, I was always bothered by the fact that something could happen to my grandpa and then I’d be all alone. I’ve still managed the get great grades, enroll in the university of central Florida and get my bachelors degree. Due to my past and my accomplishments, I couldn’t wrap my head around how someone could be depressed and not be able to accomplish the things like I have. Recently, I have been worried about my grandpa again, school is a little stressful, and I don’t really have friends. I find myself smiling around others but I feel like I’m just not happy.

Have been on SSRI in the past on/off, under supervision, for various reasons, at different times.

I don't really mind this, because I don't care much about most people I encounter either. The thing that bothers me though, is that I can't proceed to reach my personal life goals without a social network or a girlfriend. I do really want more people in my life that I genuinely care about and who therefore care about me, but I can't fake happiness and therefore push people away (also trouble with eye contact, very introverted etc). I get annoyed everytime I see joyful people and really jealous when I see someone with a good looking girlfriend, because I know that I can't achieve what they have achieved, which is true connection with a group or a partner.

So one of the things I hear and read most that people hang on to for hope is the idea that ""depression will pass even if only temporarily"" and they at least have that expectation to look for in the future but honestly I can't even imagine what being ok would be like and that might never be a possibility for me.

The thing is, I recently found out that this man I used to see and had a very complicated, unhealthy relationship with in the past (around when my depression developed) is dating a woman that I used to be close to. Now, this woman and I are not close anymore, and I have also not spoken to this man in over 4 years; however, just knowing how awful and abusive he was to me (and many others) brings back a lot of pain and anxiety, and it makes me wonder how this woman could actively date him knowing what she knows, and it bothers me, and it has been something I just can’t get out of my head. I had been running around so much recently that it was in the back of my mind, and I hadn’t sat down to deal with it till just now, but thinking about it just makes me feel awful.

Everyone’s  problems are great for themselves and all of them cannot be solved with same solutions

I was a bully victim. It started minorly from 1st grade and increased over years. I was not a “man” compared to other boys in my class. I have always been thoughtfull and empathic, peacefull and excessively naive because I haven’t experienced anyone doing harm to me until I started elementary school. Because I had one of the best family you could imagine. Exteremely thoughtfull and sacrificing parents and 2 brothers who never abused me. They raised me in a way that I thought everyone in the whole world was like them. Basically when everyone is shouting and being noisy in class, I was the type who stayed silent and patiently listened my teacher because at the age of 8(1st grade) I was able to understand that my parent were spending all of their money to give me a good teaching in a private school, since they didnt had the money for my brothers in the past, and I could see that this person(teacher) was here to help me and complete her duty, and I had to give them the respect they deserved. Yes at the age of 8... So you could say that I wasnt a regular child compared to other kids around me who were just doing whatever they want because they were, well kids. So one guy, I will call him E, and his gang of friends always picked on me. I was chubby as a kid, but also tallest in boys, in later years I was tallest among the whole class.

So they always made fun of me, you know as much of a 7-8 year old could. Call me fat, slow poke, weird etc. But I never give a crap because I just though “they can have their fun. I dont need to be friends with them.” But as we grew, around 3rd-4th grade, things got more intense. To gve some examples, I was the center of focus around the whole grade. I could never make friends with people because I was branded as a weirdo, since E had bigger friend group and always expended rumors about me and humiliated me in front of other people. And it came to the point that everyone, I mean everyone laughed or ignored my excistence. I was made fun of growing hairs and my legs in changing room, got my underwear pulled down and laughed at, kicked in balls to the point I peed blood, I got thrown wet toilet paper at my face, they banged on my bathroom doors and walls while I tried to take a shit, Got called racist and religious slurs, stabbed with a pencil right above my kidney, always told that I didnt deserved to not to live, literally E and some guys walked up behind me, tapped on my shoulder, slapped my face when I turned back, lied to teachers when I accused them of things they did(teachers never believed me because my bullies always had the advantage of number) literally called me sissy bitch immediately teacher walked away and beat me up as a gang because I tried to call a teacher on them, always got my notebooks, glasses or bag stolen/broken and many more that I want to tell but dont have time to go on.

Basically I never got my parents to belirve me as well. My mother was always suspicious when I told her about my bruises or missing belongings but my brothers or my father either told her and me that these were just kids thing, or if I was so annoyed I should tell my teachers or stand up for myself. But I didnt had the guts to tell them that none of the teachers believed me and no other kid who saw my suffering wanted to back me up AND whenever I fought back either they ran away and called verbal assaults on me from distance( as I said I was fat and they were always faster than I was) or if I managed to hit one of them when they were beating me up 5on1 (I was tall, fat and mass wise stonger than any of them on 1on1) they would run to teacher and because they had number of victim advantage on me, and got me called as guilty(basic shit school system as you may know)

So in summer after 6th grade ended, I exploded during breakfast with my parents. I cried, shouted and told them that I could not take it anymore. They realised sometime was definiteky wrong because this was the first time I told them EVERYTHING. My parents immediately took me out of that school and got me in another one. But the damage was done

I wont make this trauma and depression part as long as my school life. But after I transferred to the new school, I didnt got bullied. I made great friends despite being an outsider/ new transfer and was happy, for a while. As days went by, even though no one was bullying me, even though I left E and others behind, something was wrong. I wasnt happy. I started hating on everything. I hated humans, I started hating myself for being so naive and forgiving on their actions. I hated that none of the grown ups cared about me despite all the evidences of physical, mental and sexual abuse, I hated all of the kids who didnt bully me yet chose to be a bystander for 6 years of my torment. I hated my parents whom I loved more than my life that they didnt took action until the point I broke into thousand pieces. And so... I noticed that I was highly depressed, and extremely suicidal.

I hated every breath I took, I hated everything I ate, I hated that I had to live on not because I wanted to, but because I didnt wanted to see my mother cry if I killed myself. this repeating cycle went for SIX YEARS.

I started having professional help despite how much I disagreed to my parents pushing. First 3 of the psychiatrists couldnt help me. Last one even put me on a edge that I wanted to kill myself more because of him. I am with my 4 psychiatrist now. I started extremely agressive toward her because 3rd one completely broke my trust to any other pro help. But towards the middle of April 2020, I started to get better.

My daily routine started with crying. I either hit my head, punched walls, scratched my arms, snuffed cigarettes on my arm, hit my legs, cut my wrists and kept looking for the day to see E, so I could kill him, send him to Hell and give him a visit afterwards. I hated every second of being alive and tried to find the reason of why I was the chosen one. Why among anyone else I was to be the only one to get bullied for SIX YEARS. I wanted to kill myself just to see God and ask him that question. And yet, I didnt. I started to get better when I realised that I didnt actually wanted to die. I wanted to die, because I thought that was the most certain and fastest was to stop my pain. I kept going on for 6 more years after my depression started just telling myself that I havent killed myself because I didnt wanted to see my mother cry. On this year( 7th year of my depression) I started to see more and more about why I didnt wanted to kill myself. Biggest reason was that I didnt wanted E to win over me anymore. I have cureently wasted 12 years because of his excistence and I told myself I wont be wasting more of MY life over him This was something I had deep inside me, which overcome my hate when I encountered him on street. Yes he saw me, smiled like a bitch, hugged me called me “buddy” and I let him do it. Of course when I went home I lost myself and started laughing and breaking stuff on wall or on my head. But I managed to control myself to not to take scissors from my backpack and kill him in the middle of daylight. 

I did started doing progress since April. I realised that I dont want E the dipshit to ruin this life I can experience and be happy with. With that settled in I managed to get even better. I started losing weight via cardio. Currently I have lost 17kg in total, 23+in fat and gained 4-5 in muscle mass. I started caring about my friends in highschool that were nice and friendly to me, but I blinded myself because either I was afraid of them betraying me, or me making them sad if I managed to kill myself. I started studying and caring for my grades, currently studying for university exam for learning computet science and achieve my dreams in game coding. I want to feel love that I though I didnt deserved for years just because group of horseshit people kept telling me to.

Dont get me wrong, I am not telling that I have overcome everything. My hands are still shaking, I do still have nightmares, I still am afraid of losing my control in spitr on anger. But most of all, despite all of my bad days, I am afraid yo return to my old self. Im afraid of becoming who I was, that suicidal, hateful mess, more than anything. Bad day surely arent every second every day now, but they do still happen.

But here I am, telling my story, hoping for a better tomorrow despite ongoing struggle. I who had only 2 goals, to make E suffer and at least myself is still breathing and genuinely smiling for happier days.

I cannot tell you how to realise that you are not the mistake or the wrong one or how to feel better about yourself because my Psychiatrists, my family and my friends did tell me, hell even I told myself that I was innocent from time to time but it didntmadw me better immediately. But I will tell you 2 things that I hope will help to end your pain. 
1) Look for what you really want and never give up on that. Even if you dont have the energy to reach to it, keep going. Force yourself more than you already are doing. Trust me I know how much it hurts when you maybe are forcing yourself to just breathe and keep on the daily life and someone is telling you to work harder. I know the feeling trust me. Unfortunalely life, karma and reality are all bitches. We, the one who are treated unfairly have to work harder şn addition to odds being against us. But never, ever forget that if you dont give up, you will reach the absolute and find the peace you deserve. But if you give up, all of the hardships you faced, all of the pain you endured and currently enduring will be for nothing. Always remind this to yourself.

2) Love yourself. I know, it is one of the hardest things to do because hate is always easier compared to love. But thing happened to you are not your fault. People are scum, justice is dead, life is a bitch but you? You are amazing. You are the bravest and strongest soul ever alive because you, despite everything happened are still fighting. You may be dangling off a cliff almost ready to give yp but you are still here! Still strong! Still alive! Every breath you take is at least equal to other people that you may think that are more important than you are. You deserve to be loved. Just keep working for that lave and mever expect for it to happen at once. You may fail once or twice, maybe 100 times but there is always and always another chance to try harder and get what you deserve. I love you, we all love you. But most importantly, you love yorself. You may hate a part of who you are now, or who you were in the past but you, the one who is trying to reborn from the ash and dirt.”, the one that you are, the one and only you that is alive and know only by your own self, deserves the happiness that you crave. Never give up and always always remind yourself how much you love yourself and NEVER let anyone elses thoughts corrupt what you really want or who you areally are.

Stay safe, We are all here with you.","I know you can do it, and you will, because I didn’t believe I could and yet, I am finally making progress",1

My elder brother constantly makes fun of weight even though I jog 3k thrice a week. If I do well in an exam my parents tell that the exam was easy or that I fluked it. If I do bad I get a 30min lecture on why I did bad and should be like my brother. Due to Covid I have lost all contacts with my friends and have no one really to talk to. My self esteem has literally gone to hell. I look in the mirror and see a fat fuck who is worthless. My parents are 'scared' to send me to a foreign country to study(university) because they think imma start smoking and drinking whereas they didn't think twice before sending my brother away.

720,"I'm a severely depressed 22 year old girl, and I still live at home with my parents. 

I've loved animals all my life and we used to have dogs at home but they passed away a few years ago. No one in my family has even thought about getting a new one, they don't really care. I've taken care of dogs many times before and I have even volunteered at two different dog day cares and spent time there for almost a year. But even then I still don't have my own dog, because my dad and my mom thinks it's too much of a responsibility so they don't want to get one. I even suggested getting a cat because they should be easier to take care of since they're more independent and don't need to go out for walks everyday, but even then they said no for various dumb reasons like ""the litter box stinks"". 

I don't know what to do anymore, I'm so lonely, I have zero friends and I get no love or affection from my family. I know that if I had a dog or a cat it would make my life a billion times better, I would have a reason to live. Every time I see a dog outside I get so sad and jealous because I think to myself how much I would want my own dog to go for walks with, a dog to love and care for, and a dog that will love and appreciate me back. My family has never really been affectionate with me or cared about me.

Because of this I spend most of my time alone in my room playing video games. I'm not happy. I never go outside. I've tried therapy, medication, CBT, everything, and nothing works. I'm always the happiest when I'm around dogs and cats, they don't judge me, they just appreciate me and love me for who I am. What do I do? I've brought it up multiple times but I just get ignored or I get these counterarguments like ""It's a big responsibility, you can't travel if you have them, they cost money, they live for a long time, and you can't just get rid of them"" but my depression is so bad that I don't even want to live and I've felt that way for a long time.... I already know about all these responsibilities.

I always keep reading these posts and stories about depressed and mentally ill people who say that getting a pet (especially a cat or a dog) has literally saved their lives. It made them happy and they felt loved and had something to take care of so they felt like they were needed in life. I want to be happy and feel that way too. I want to feel loved and appreciated, and have something to take care of and give love to. Spending so much time around dogs but not having my own really hurts because at the end of the day I'm not the one who gets to lie in bed and cuddle with my biggest life companion.

What can I do? I feel like I should be old enough to take care of a dog or a cat on my own, being over 22 years old and all. I know I could handle a pet like a dog or a cat, because I'm a very responsible person. This is why I feel so let down and disappointed by my family and it's making my depression even worse. There's no way I can move out soon either because finding a place to live here is nearly impossible. Any help or advice? I feel like I'm just done with life, I'm so lonely.  

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - I'm 22 and I live at home, I want a dog or a cat because I'm certain it would help with my severe depression but my parents say no. It's making me so depressed I don't know what to do anymore. I have no friends, and being around other people's dogs just isn't the same.","I'm so depresesd and lonely, all I want is a dog or a cat",1
721,"i’ve had plenty of issues with depression and anxiety and whatnot and in the pay few months i’ve been working to try to work things out and get better.  but some days when i do feel better i begin to doubt myself, asking if i was ever really sick in the first place. a lot of the time i don’t even know if i want to get better anymore, ive grown so comfortable with wallowing in my own bad thoughts and never being afraid of anything because it felt like i didn’t have anything left to lose, not even my own life. i should be proud of being better but i still smoke up, avoid meals and plenty of the other unhealthy methods, i still think these thoughts and hold myself back from improving. do i even want to improve now? the line between what’s real and what’s in my head has blurred, the idea of living however many more years makes me feel sick. i don’t know what i’m doing, who i am or where i’ll go.

722,"It's been a little while since I've been here. Not since I've been depressed, just since I've sunk so deep. I think quarantine is making it worse in that now the loneliness that plagues me isn't just mental, it's physical too.

My head hurts and I'm probably not being as coherent as I could be, I've been struggling with that at the moment. It's difficult to recognise what I'm feeling because I'm so used to pushing emotions away. Once I do overcome that hurdle, it's difficult to put those feelings to words because brain fog. 

I haven't journalled in about a month. It's funny how the pages always go blank during the dark times when I really need the expression the most. 

There's so many things I'm on the brink of relapsing into, and so many new destructive coping mechanisms that I'm starting up. But at this point the anxiety has left me and I'm not really scrambling to stay afloat anymore, I'm just rather emotionlessly watching myself sink. 

It's funny, seeing myself fall back into this place again. Because somehow I got it into my brain that this time I might succeed. Hope is a poisonous thing,  it just makes you fall harder. Letting myself have it for even a moment was a mistake.","And so, the cycle continues",1
723,"Sounds over dramatic I know but when I think about it I always come to this conclusion. I work for a job that pays just above minimum wage and it’s a call center job. I spend 40 hours a week being a punching bag for asshole customers and then being bitched at by management that I’m not being a happy enough punching bag. It doesn’t ever matter what I do right it’s all about the stats I didn’t meet even if I am literally doing everything how I am supposed to as long as I’m not meeting the numbers it’s still my fault. 

I had to drop out of school to take care of and watch my mom die from cancer so I had to get my ged. I’ll never go to college. I’m not very smart I have no talents whatsoever I’m not good at anything. I have no skills. I’m lazy cause nothing matters and I don’t even care any more. I’ll never succeed at trying. 

I used to try I used to put all my effort into trying getting to work sometimes an hour early taking everything seriously I would work so hard trying to be worth something. I would try and try and try. And no matter what I did or do it’s the same result as when I don’t try at all. Because at this company they treat the people that do try the same as people that don’t try. And now I don’t try. I don’t try to do anything but the bear minimum that lets me keep my job. I’ve stopped trying in life too. I don’t cook I don’t clean i don’t do anything. Nothing is worth it. Even the few times I try to do something I end up fucking it up somehow and then getting yelled at. People get mad anyways when you don’t try but not as bad when you fuck something up. 

All I want is someone to love me. I’m living with my best friend and roomAte who I love more then practically snything. I would die for her in a heartbeat and it doesn’t bother me that she wouldn’t do the same. Never has. What does bother me is the fact that she doesn’t care about me at all. She hates all humans because she has a bad past and tells me I’m no exception. She has dreams of me killing myself from my own stupidity on accident and then she cuts my corpse up and feeds me to people in the dreams and never feels sad about me dying. She said that if she were paid a million bucks to kill me, she would kill me in a heartbeat. She says she would feel bad later but that humans are greedy and that is why she would do it. She tells me all the time that she loves her cat more than she loves me or even her own boyfriend. These things hurt me. I know I can’t change her and it is my fault for being friends with someone that just doesn’t care about me. It isn’t her fault it isn’t like she is being secretive. But I love her anyways. I can’t stop loving her and it kills me sometimes. 

I just want it to end. I’m never gonna be out of this miserable cycle. I’m not smart or talented enough to get a job that won’t destroy me and I don’t want to keep living without love. I feel used sometimes, she lost her job due to unfair circumstances so she is living with me and I have to pay her bills . I know she isn’t using me on purpose that way. Financially. She hates havin to do it and I know that but when I think of how she doesn’t give a fuck about me anyways it feels like I’m being used. 

I’ve been used my entire fucking life over and over. My mom used me my dad used me worse my grandma used me and now I am living to provide for my feiend, the difference is that she doesn’t pretend to care about me like the others did. And when she is done she will move in with her boyfriend and then I’ll find someone else to use me. The short period of time in my life where I was living on my own and not being used I spent desperately trying to be useful to everyone around me cause it’s all I know. And I felt miserable and alone until I got to help someone some way. I will repeat this pattern my whole life till I die. 

People don’t change and I just want it to end now but I’m scared of death. One day I hope I get scared of this life I’m suffering through so I can end it finally. I’ll die as I lived in a pathetically useless way that no one will even care about.

I wish my life had meaning. I wish I were loved and I wish I had some good quality that could help me to achieve something in life but reality isn’t what you want it to be.

I've gone through the whole list of available SSRIs and SNRIs trying to find something that works and about a year and a half ago my specialist settled on Lamictal and Cymbalta as my primary psych duo. She added Tenex later to help me shut my mind off so I can sleep, and Vyvanse for binge eating. I went for a regular follow-up a couple weeks back and told her I've felt so unmotivated and just kinda 'blah' - I'm sure you all know what I'm poorly describing. She asked if I wanted to try Trintellix, which my sister (nurse at a family practice) had already been telling me to ask about, so I jumped at it. Doc decides to start me on Trintellix at a half dose for two weeks then full dose; and has me take half the dose of Cymbalta and Tenex for two weeks then stop; she also full stops the Vyvanse. Lamictal stays the same.

I was super tired the first week of the process - which I expected from coming off the Vyvanse - but nothing of note besides that. My last dose of Cymbalta and Tenex was Friday. I've had brain zaps (if you know, you know) and migraines and have been soooo irritable and haven't been able to control my crying and I am just so over it already.

I’ve always had depression, but it really hit me hard this year. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s the pandemic and how the world feels flipped on its axis — but I’ve never had depression interfere with my life the way that it has this year. 

I’m a third year law student and I have an internship at the place where I’d ultimately like to start working. I’ve been working remotely for most of my internship because I have been so depressed (I’m allowed to because of COVID, but I feel as though I should be going in to see people and etc.), which started in August (and I’m doing a shitty job at it). I’m afraid that everyone at work hates me and that I’m seen as a poor worker. I don’t come in when I say that I will, not that anyone really needs me, but I don’t even look like a person of my word — depression tells me to just stay in bed, be by myself, and watch Grey’s Anatomy all day. 
I’m afraid that I’m ruining my chances at getting a full-time job for myself because of how shitty I’ve been. But I’m not a poor worker. I’ve worked hard my whole life. I’m not a procrastinator or a slacker and I never have been. 

I’m also worried about my grades. I’ve missed class several times or half-assed my schoolwork because of depression. It’s been really tough. If I’m not in my bed watching TV, I feel burned out and exhausted.

My dad got really sick and he makes me hard to help him because he is a narcissist. My mom fighting for me but is also not ready to unterstand me. She's so desperate and sad about me. 

I expect so much of my friends that I decided to push them away because to have me as a friend must be terrible. 
Am I not the only one, who expect so much but push every help away at the same time? 

Also school is so difficult for me. The new people all the time because I have to change so often. The talking in front of the class and the pressure to be the best and to look the best. I’m so bad at school but I’m learning so much und understand it at home. My brain doesn’t work in exams, it’s to much. The noises and feelings from others in the room are too loud, I can hardly concentrate. It’s my last chance this year to make the school level and to go on.

I destroy my body with unhealthy food and at the other time with no food at all. I was diagnosed with an eating disorder (anorexic) three years ago but never really got some time to recover so I kind of stuck in this still.

I was kind of pretty and smart und full of passion. Now I’m destroying everything and everybody around me. How can I stop not using my life.

745,"I'm a 16 year old high school senior in the US. I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for over 2 years, but my mental health has gotten to its lowest point lately.

I had a suicide attempt about a week ago. These past few months I've barely been eating, showering, or taking basic care of myself. If I'm not in class, I probably spend all my time online or gaming to distract myself from everything. I have at least 2 small mental breakdowns a day.

I'm usually a very good student but for the first time in my life I've been missing classes due to oversleeping, not handing in assignments, doing badly on tests, etc. It's affected my college application process.

I am so burnt out and so defeated. Every waking moment is hard no matter how much I try to adopt a positive mindset.

But I can still get out of bed in the morning and if I really push myself I can do assignments or concentrate for short periods of time, like how I am writing this post. And I still care about my grades despite having no motivation to do any work. It feels really dramatic and selfish of me to want to go to the hospital because I am still capable of doing things sometimes. 

Most of the teens who share their experience there say it was horrible and that they were treated like animals. Also, my parents aren't supportive and I know they will take it the wrong way or see me in a different light if I go. Not to mention, I would miss several school days and be even more behind.

749,"I’m 17(turns 18 next month) currently in my second year of gymnasiet (danish High School), and i feel depressed. I have 1,5 years until I graduate and I actually have plans after high school to join the danish Air Force (I have a very strong passion for flying). But 1,5 years seems like an eternity if I’m just bored and depressed. Pre COVID i was actually doing fine because I had something to look forward to every week. Often there was a party or an event of some sort, or I had plans with my friends, and therefore I could keep a high functioning level of my training, running, diet, chores, school assignments etc. But now because of COVID there’s no events. And more often I find myself being alone, bored and depressed at the weekends, which were the highlight of my week before and therefore I could keep my motivation high in everyday life. And when I can’t keep my motivation in everyday life, I’m just lazy. I have no energy, I binge/stress eat and just get into bad habits. I think the only thing I have to look forward to is my plans after high school, but that’s far away in my life, at least I think. I feel like if I had girlfriend or a really good friend I could hang with, it would be easier to get through high school, but I don’t have that. And yes, I really think that I just have to get through high school, because the way I see it, my life just starts when I begin my education in the Air Force.

751,"I'm a 25-year-old girl. I'll just get straight to the point. I have no friends, no boyfriend, nothing. Somehow I was the popular girl in class (I'm doing masters), and I was always surrounded by a huge group of ""friends"". All that changed this quarantine. I began to see how much I was never really needed in these people's lives. It first hit me on my birthday - the people I thought were close to me, didn't even bother doing a video call for me, or even send anything on my birthday. This was in stark contrast to another girl's birthday in the group - they all had a video call (I was told to join), made a loving video for her (compilation of clips and pictures), and had a small virtual party for her. 

This really hurt me, and over the next few months, I saw them drifting more and more away. Now, this has been the pattern for ""friends"" throughout my life - my work friends, and even school friends. These all are people I was immensely close to at one point.   But now I'm not in touch with anyone. Whenever I do try to strike up conversations, they just humor me for a few minutes before ending the conversation. Or other times, they are already close with each other as a group and I feel like an outsider. 

Another thing - whenever I thought I was best friends with someone, they instantly replaced me with someone bubblier, more extroverted, or more ""fun"" within months. This has happened to me since my school days. It hurt me a lot but I didn't speak about it for fear of looking desperate or being ridiculed. So I bottle it all in. An incident that will be always etched in my mind is something that happened on my 22nd birthday - my boyfriend at the time had broken up with me, and I was all alone. There was a girl who I naively thought was my best friend up until that time. I ended up buying and taking a cake to her place in the hopes that we would celebrate my bday, or maybe she had something planned for me (she did it for all her other friends). When I got there, she looked surprised and very very much like she pitied me. She hadn't even remembered my birthday. 

It's come to the point that legit the only people that truly care for me and have time for me are my parents. That's it.

The first was nice, but always late to the appointments, she made me feel like a person and bought me coffee sometimes, but after three months of ""we'll start threatement next week, once we are done going over all the possible problems"" and knowing she was going on maternal leave, I decided to switch

The second was harsher, less motherly and more you can and will get your life together. Dismissed some trauma as unimportant and I couldn't bring myself to tell her it was important for me. Once our time was up (because it was a three and a half month insurance thing), she told me I had to see a specialized doctor, because regular treatement would not do.

The third one came a year later, after I was feeling in another plane due to the lack of meds and was already on my third go to sleep and maybe never wake up attempt. She seemed to have a method, asked me the right questions and I had hope for a moment, but then the next session she forgot about what she asked me to do, never checked on progress, I just felt like a moneybag in her eyes. My mom, who has been critical of all my therapists, told me I should stop seeing her so I did.

The only specialized therapist I have been recommended has been a man, and I refuse to go with him. I can't talk with men on the regular, going to a male therapist would just be a waste of money.

I'm still fucked in the head, I know that, almost every mental health professional I've seen has stated that, while they don't know what is wrong with me they are pretty sure it's a long term thing, and will not be fixed like a regular depression. Why should I keep trying, if I have tried so many times and ended up with people just not knowing what to do with me?

I don't know if I'm too stubborn and impatient to stick to one and see the fruits or if it's my mom constantly asking for results and giving an angry speech about how they are not helping me and I should look for someone who will or just what even, maybe I don't even need help maybe I'm just making this whole shit up as an excuse to not take control of my life and just be a money leech, I just know I am tired of people telling me to get help when I already /tried/ and it didn't work.

I look back at the earlier days of my YouTube channel, I was always drunk filming Minecraft videos, I was so depressed, I was always traveling and I had a really abusive partner. The Minecraft videos I filmed from back then are not things that I exactly am proud of and overall my life was terrible but for some reason I was a lot happier and I don't understand why. I have a good life now yet I kind of wish I never met my boyfriend and I wish I could have just gone down another drunken rabbit hole. 

&amp;#x200B;

When I try to think of the reason why i'm feeling this way, I just end up thinking about my content and that maybe I miss being such a self-destructive person because that's what people liked to watch. Making videos feels so spiritually taxing these days, I often think about turning off the camera for a while just because it causes so much stress. If I didn't have the camera on I wouldn't have to worry about looking good on camera, I wouldn't have to worry about lighting and wouldn't have to worry about camera quality. But removing the camera is not something I ever want to do, I love seeing my face on my videos because I feel like I get to see myself at a certain point of time even if I am putting on a fake voice . 

 

What I mean by that by the way is that my voice in my videos is not how I actually sound, I deepen my voice because I feel like people take me more seriously with a deeper voice, I also just feel like if I could create the perfect version of myself I would have a deep voice, I dislike my natural voice so much, I used to be made fun of all the time for having such a high voice. 

&amp;#x200B;

Back to the main point, I'm just unhappy with everything for some reason, I really want to know what will make me happy. I'm about to have a new office space, a new microphone, a new camera, a new lighting setup and a new computer. But will this really make me happy? I think In this moment that it will but I feel like that's just me excited for new tech to mess with.

Over the next 3 years, we became best friends. We told each other everything, we would hang out all the time, we were inseparable. She was my closest friend. That all changed during quarantine.

School has always been a huge stressor for me. My sophomore year I got overwhelmed and ended up being institutionalized. After I got out, the school was really good about helping me get back on track and my grades ended up really good that semester. 

This year when I realized I was getting overwhelmed, I took a step back to really focus on my mental health and ended up being able to heal without slipping into an extremely severe depressive episode. As a result of me stepping back, I’m currently failing most of my classes.

Now, I’m trying to get my schoolwork back on track. However, I ended up talking to my school’s office of student rights and responsibilities and they basically told me “too bad, we can’t help you, hope it works out.”

I don’t know what to expect from this post. I suffer from depression since ... November 2018. I was in a relationship at this time with a great girl. But I felt lonely because she worked a lot and was focused on her needs. I became more and more depressed and I met someone. This feeling to be listen and admire in a way felt good and I decided to end my relationship in March 2019. That was a mistake but I realize that just a couple of months ago.
This « new » relationship didn’t even start because the girl didn’t attract me despite her soft words. I stayed alone and came back with my ex. But things had changed, we lived like that for 3 months before I ended this relationship again (I wasn’t aware at the time of this mistake).
I met a girl right away, or even during my break-up. She was everything I was looking for. But do you remind the « hot girl craziness chart » ? She was. She broke up with me 6 months after (May 2020) to come back with her ex. And come back again to me because they didn’t fix their problems.

Let’s fast forward to tomorrow:
I am alone. The crazy girl comes back to me from time to time and throws me away again and again (I think she will go back with her ex in the upcoming days). My ex will move to her new boyfriend flat in 2 months (they are in a relationship since our last break-up).

I had some dark thoughts since this summer. I feel lonely and because of this pandemic I don’t think I will meet someone any time soon. I’m tired of this situation. I messed up and I deserve that situation in a way. But I’m struggling to fight. To be honest I let myself couple of months to fix my sh*t but time is running out and I don’t see the end of the tunnel.

I do sports, I try to eat well, I talk to people, I’m currently changing my habits and my flat to feel better. I used to see a psychologist for months but nothing work, really. I always thought that I was born to love someone and make her life better, brighter. I don’t know how to love loneliness and myself, it’s the opposite in fact. I miss my old relationship, I miss my life before this depression.

I don’t know what to do before feeling worse.

779,"This year has really thrown me through the ringer. And what sucks even more is that I feel for so many  people who have gone through worse. 

I was working my way up in the film industry. I had moved to LA 4 years ago and as of December 19’ , I had finally landed a good job with a ton of potential to move up. I was working audio on Netflix shows, Apple TV + shows, Amazon shows and Sony and Universal movies. I got to handle raw footage and audio from sets, and deliver to streaming services / studios for finalizing. It was so great!

Covid hit and , firstly, I was getting overtime ( coworkers took the extra offered sick time to avoid being in the work place ) I thought this is where I’m going to shine, prove myself but completing the work of 3 people and showing I was a team player.

But then in April, on the 2nd , I got a call my grandfather in NY got Covid. I was so worried. He got worse and worse and worse and finally on the 15th he died of it. 

He raised me as a father , my dad wasn’t ever in the picture. I loved that man and while he was 80, he was healthy, working, driving, and even doing the books for the restaurant he managed for years. He only had diabetes I know he had more time. 

The same day that phone call happened was the day I got laid off from work as the studios had stopped paying my company in a freeze.

All the hard work and effort and team player-ness I showed was just gone. They shut down completely . 

I decided to move back to NY. I didn’t have much savings the job didn’t pay a lot just enough to get by with hopes of moving up. I just didn’t know where my rent was coming from and unemployment was backed up in California. 

Coming home, it’s been nice. My best friends have kids and houses now, and they call me uncle. I stay with family , help take care of my grandmother. 

I was able to get work in my field in NYC, but it’s not doing what I want and I don’t see any chances of moving up here. 

My boss today added new responsibility’s on me, after last weeks pay check was less because apparently they were paying me for a few hours I didn’t work . I get it, I didn’t earn that money, but I never looked at the stubs with direct deposit so when you’re used to an income it just feels like a demotion. 

Then I hear the train I take from Long Island into the city is going to raise the already high rate, then the health insurance offer comes in,

I just feel like I’m losing money from my paycheck left and right. I’ll never be able to afford rent.

I don’t have my grandfather who was always my go-to , to ask advice. 

And I’ve been gaining weight because I stress eat.

Been trying to put myself out there for dating but all I get are fun and genuine dinners, with ghosting the next day. It makes me feel used.

When my boss added on new responsibilities today I dunno, I’m not that good at what I’m doing yet, it’s new to me. I’ve told him this. So with more work and less time , I started to hyperventilate, and it took me a minute to control it.

Then I just cried. 

Thank God I have my own office. Due to Covid I’m using a room that would otherwise be occupied but everyone else in this company works from home. 

I know many have it worse than me, I don’t know if I could be as strong.

I lost my mom in 2016, my grandfather in April, and my family is getting so small so fast. 

I just want to make something of myself. I’m 32 years old, and I feel like such a failure. I hate myself I hate who I see in the mirror .

I have a thick head of hair and the last two weeks I’m finding hair in my hands when I shower and use shampoo. 

I cry in the car driving home from the train station. I just,

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ll never catch up in life. I want kids, a family, but these things just feel so out of reach it’s the same to me as wanting to win the lottery. Almost no chance even when you try .

I’m so scared of the future. Covid numbers are spiking, half the country doesn’t take it seriously, the government wants to pretend that any help is socialism while they themselves live with free top of the line healthcare and incomes that I could only dream of. 

I haven’t seen a doctor in years. I have no idea what I need to watch out for and I sure as shit won’t ever catch anything early. 

I never used to worry like this . But I just hate my life and even before Covid it was an uphill battle. 

Now I just, I don’t know.

804,"So, backstory to begin: when I was around 20-21  I hit bottom at college, graphic design student and decided to go check with the campus psychologist, I was passing an anxiety episode, she  gave me some pills to calm me in the moment, got an appointment with the psychiatrist, anxiety and depression diagnosis, recommended to get some pills. Well, I live with my parents and sharing them my condition, first reaction was questioning me is that was true, who said so? he wanted proof. So I had to go both with the campus psycologist (which was not oriented to those cases, more like student academic support thing) he demmanded to get into the appointment, he made all the questions, respond to the psychiatrist whatever he felt was going on with me and I could barely say a word (will explain more ahead). Then, the appointment with the psychiatrist, same experience: dad conducted the appointment, the only thing I did was say yes yes yes to whatever he spoke (mostly none were near the real reasons, but hey, he´s the type of person who doesn´t listen anyway), and the only conscious thing I said where what should i take and how often, again, I couldn´t speak more than that. I took the meds for around 6 months, but didn´t had a official therapy with psychologist, money was tight, and I didn´t want to be obligated to have appointments with dad present in every session; honestly I never felt more controled and invalidated in my life. Basically, I was living in auto-mode, acting like yeah yeah I feel better, or I should be if I am still alive right? and trying to do the college courses. And then, i decided to stop taking the pills, I thought they were actually doing nothing, which was obviously a bad idea but I didn´t care enough. 

Years later, I was still living with anxiety, but to a level no one could discover, I could finish my career, got a job. Like cycles, some days were: I better focus on my work and put my problems on hold, distract myself, neglect my feelings with guilt: you have family, a house to live, food, a job, how the hell can you be depressed? look around, you could be in a worst situation? don´t be pathetic... same thoughts, same voices in my head: you just want attention, shame on you... your problems don't matter, they are all made up... are you sure they can be considered problems ?...

Then, it took me a couple years to realize some things: I tend to avoid people, making lasting or meaningful friendships was always too hard (I can get along with people but only in a superficial level) and one thing that sounds ""stupid"" **but the most important**: whenever I was put into heavy stress for personal topics and talking one on one with someone really close to me (which is always 1 person at the time or year, I don´t know better how to write it) what happens is that I basically start crying,  and **become incapable of pronouncing a word**, I know what to say in my mind, I really try to open my mouth and say it but my body doesn´t respond, my throat starts to feel like I am choking, it really hurts like something is trying to crush it; same with my jaw, it becomes locked. If the tension continues to build up my mind feels numb and then full fear takes control of me without a ""real world danger"" just pure pure fear out of nowhere, driving me in spirals into the void. It´s like something, a voice in the back of my mind trying to ""protect me"" by just being silent, otherwise things would be worst. The sensations lasts until I leave the situation, leading to exhaustion later.

Anyway, the dumb part is that I never questioned if that type of reaction was average, and it sucks... it really does... I always wondered how  most people I know can freely say what they are feeling, or their opinion with so much ease... but for me it´s a nightmare, it´s either I blush, and start sweating, my jaw shakes, my voice crackles on the not-so-high stress levels, or going into tears, with pain in my jaw, throat, and chest; in the end, I can´t express whatever I´m trying to. It took me so long to use writing or texting instead (really, I've been just trying to write instead of speak from like 2 years ago), it is still hard as hell to type even this post though it's less physically painful, i still feel all the symptoms above but in a lesser grade. 

Now these days with the pandemic and all... yeah, hello depression again... some days I have the energy to still mantain the auto-mode of living; some others, I just hold the emptyness of why do i have to still live if dont't want to, it would be better to be able to just disappear into the nothing for my own sake.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: it sucks to feel strangled (literally) every single time I try to express my feelings, or true opinions; it's like my body is boicoting me into remain silent ""for my own good"", or just neglect whatever I feel with ""oh no, of course you can't feel that way, you can't feel anger, you cant' feel sadness... I mean, you have NO right to feel that way, because your reasons are invalid and you are wrong""",The struggle of even trying to speak,1

808,"hi,

excuse my username, this is a throwaway account, but mr. incredible isn't feeling too incredible. 

I'm 21, uni student and i'm currently in the UK and feel like i'm struggling with the pandemic and lockdown going on. feel like i'm reliving the same day over and over again, slowly dropping habits i used to have like daily exercise - I used to go to the gym a lot and was in decent shape. i don't eat as much and i think i'm now starting to lose weight. I have a fucked up sleep schedule and can't seem to fix it or want to get out of bed. i miss my girlfriend so much, i really want to visit her and am just contemplating going as i reckon it would improve my mood so much. I seem to be under the impression that the relationship is doomed to fail at any given time and am having intrusive thoughts about splitting up with her which is really getting me down, I don't know if these thoughts are true or not. Initially I was dead set on marrying this girl but my anxieties have clouded my judgement. I look forward to calling her everyday and we watch movies on netflix together which I love. During the call I look forward to other things like playing games with the boys on PS4 and convince myself that I musn't be in love with her if I want to get off the call and do something else - which I absolutely know is bullshit. But when the day is over and I'm in bed, I'm left with my thoughts and they drive me down a deep hole. My girlfriend offered to move in with her and her household, but i'm already paying for my flat and I can't leave my only flatmate (who also suffers from depression) alone. I used to play golf a lot but all the golf centres are closed and I just don't have the motivation. I also used to play music and do a lot of live shows - I'm a massive Ed Sheeran fan but I left my guitar at home as I didn't think i'd need it. I'm slipping with my uni work and falling VERY far behind. I've started streaming and making youtube videos but even that is starting to exhaust me and making me wonder if it's what I really want. The future is very murky at the moment and it scares me as I don't see anything joyful coming for me. I was looking forward to getting married to my girlfriend, getting a job and having kids etc but that's all looking murky rn and it's getting me down. I had a rise in mood a few weeks ago but it's fallen down again. Honestly I'm just holding out until I can go home to my family and see my girlfriend for Christmas. I keep telling myself to give myself a break as we are in a pandemic but it doesn't improve my mood at all. I find myself feeling very envious of the past where I was in a much better state - had a job placement lined up and was feeling optimistic and now a year later I'm stuck in a awful place. I miss my family, my girlfriend and my friends. I can't even visit the friends I have at uni. Honestly, the only things keeping me afloat besides calls to my loved ones are football matches and I feel like if my team underperforms or loses that's my mood ruined for the rest of the day. If they win, I'm on cloud nine for a while and then a few hours later back in the same place as before.

I probably sound really crazy but I just needed somewhere to rant as I don't know who to talk to without placing too much pressure on my friends. It's all just a mind-dump really.

During this pandemic I’ve been working really hard. I’ve moved up in my career, gotten rid of a lot of the toxicity in my life, and cut out so many substances that were keeping me depressed.

My problem is that while I’ve gone out and done those things, I feel like I’ve done them because of my depression and anxiety. I’m in the career path that I enjoy and I’m happy to be in. I’ve got great people around me. But I still feel so below them. Maybe it’s more my anxiety but nowadays all the time I spend on my own I don’t do anything. I have the inspiration to change but not the motivation. Some days I can’t even talk to my coworkers because I’m afraid.

What I’m curious of, is if there’s anyone who might be able to send some words of wisdom or support. I’m not at a point where I want to harm myself or anyone/thing. But I’ve gotten there in the past and I fear being in that place again. I’ve had such strong urges to go back to some of the things I’d put in my body but I’ve yet to do so.

I (22M) got into an intense argument with my family. Nothing new, except this one devolved into fists flying. I started when my father (50M) entered my room to ask me to take out the trash. I responded with a stupid joke, something to the effect of ""when the country turns 300"". Now instead of just accepting that for what it was (a dumb snarky joke that meant in a few minutes) h became angry. He started saying nasty stuff to me (""You're a lazy ass who doesn't want to do shit, I should have never let you guys buy an Xbox because you won't do shit"") and I told him that if he's going to talk to me that way then he can take it out himself. He then responds by unplugging the internet modem and then reenters my room. I got very angry and told him to stop being an asshole. He then raises his fists and tells me that I cannot do anything about it. That's when I approach him and give him a left hook to the face. His demeanor, which was agressive and he seemingly wanted to fight me, is what pushed me into the rage abyss. Me and him go at it for awhile, and then he calls on my sister (the only family member that cares enough about him to do so) to call the police, and then he attempted to restrain me and he begins saying he's going to have me arrested. I had a bolt of adrenaline and pushed him off of me, he attempted to grab me again so I launched a stool at him and left. 30 mins later pass and I am under an overpass bleeding from the face, and my father calls and the police are on the other end. They said that they are leaving but if they have to return that I would be arrested. I told them that I will not return or even commit suicide if they did not leave the premises. They said that they were leaving, so I returned home. I found my father in tears, but I felt no remorse as I saw that as just a formal consequence of his actions.

This is a bit of a brain dump but I’m struggling to overcome reliving a pretty severe incident when I’m exercising. 

A quick overview. I was kidnapped at gunpoint and held hostage in South America whilst travelling 11 months ago Dec 5th 2019. 

Since surviving the ordeal I’ve been through the NHS PTSD program and it’s done the world of good. 

I’m now able to sleep most nights now and live a lot less fearful of people. There are days it’s horrible and it’s tough but I understand I can get through it. 

However whenever I go for a run I get really severe flashbacks and physically impacts me. Erratic breathing, dread and fear. 

I’m working on it with a psychiatrist and hoping it will get better. I think part of it’s me needing to process it out of my head. 

Running was how I survived the kidnapping. I assume I subconsciously associate running with it and it starts to pop into my mind. 

Anyways, I wondered if anyone had come across a similar pattern and ways you were able to disassociate a common action with trauma? 

Thanks for any advice and If anyone’s struggling with PTSD or depression and wants to chat ask about the treatment I went through I’m happy to chat or answer. 

Stay safe.

852,"Hello. I never really thought I would say anything in a place like this. Before this year I had never really struggled with depression, I had severe ADHD, but was a really happy person overall. Now, ever since a breakup about 8 months ago and the extreme anxiety that I now struggle with thanks to COVID and other factors, such as not doing really well in college (my fault) I don't really want to be here anymore. The relationship didn't last very long, and I really shouldn't have reacted the way I did, but the main thing I struggle with is the guilt I feel for the way I acted before and after the realationship. I worry that I'm the kind of person who does not deserve to be forgiven, that what I did was truly despicable. I don't really know what to do anymore, and I don't know how to know if I am a good or bad person. I understand it's not that simple, and that I should learn to move on and learn from my mistakes but I just can't. Some days I feel fine, especially parts of some days I feel like I used to. But at the same time there are so many parts of the day where I just look somewhere and start planning how I would end my life, whether I could actually do it, practically or feasibly. I ask my freinds if I'm a good person or not, and they sure yes, they know the other person involved, but I can never bring myself to tell the whole story of what happened, or when I have I can't really bring myself to do it in a unbiased way. I wish she would just tell everyone exactly what went down, just so people would judge me truly, but she say's that it's really only between us.

856,"Hi,

I had a severe depression and it was going on for a few years. I just kept getting deeper and deeper into the hole.

I finally decided to get treatment and went straight to a psychiatrist to get a diagnosis. It turned out that my case could be treated with pills.

Jesus Christ how much better I got - the first two weeks were just terrible but from then on it got better and better. My family, friends - everyone noticed the difference. 

Prior to making a first step I imagined I would need to 'talk it out' (which I didn't believe in) with a therapist and spend huge amounts of cash which I didn't have. 

It turned out that I only paid $50 for a visit every 3 months. Plus the pills - $30/month. 

The treatment is supposed to take 12 months, I'm near the end of it and I cannot believe how much can change in such a short period of time. It was the best decision of my life.

If you're where I was a while ago - thinking it's all over, YSK it's worth giving science a shot. There's a chance you're ill - just like a flu. And a doctor might get you out of it.

PS If you're in US and these things are too expensive for you, some countries of the EU have really good, certified doctors that are more affordable and can speak very good English. I have most of my visits online so I could be in America and the doctor would still cost this much. 

PPS I know that somethimes the therapy is the way to go and know nothing about it. So please do not misunderstand me - if I had the money to do it, I'd get a therapist too. 

Have a good day :)","I didn't know it, do you?",1

Sure, I know everyone has their ups and downs, but this never-ending nightmare still shows no signs of ending. And it's been going on for too long. It's almost as if the universe is against me. I tried everything. and I still fail every time.

I've literally exhausted myself from working and what for? What's the fucking point if it doesn't change anything? No matter how much effort I put in, it's never going to pay. No matter what I do or even attempt at doing, it backfires on me and and my situation gets x1000 worse. 

I'm sick of dealing with this shit. I've sacrificed way too much of my time and health for literally no-thing. People seem to have it their way so effortlessly and I can't help but feeling jealous. They get praised and achieve MY goals without 1/1000 of all the shit i have to go through. It's not fair.

Sometimes, I think about how different it would be if I died 4 years before shit hit the fan. 

How different people would remember you when your name casually pops up in a conversation.

People around me would probably be better off without my existence, knowing I only cause them stress and pain.

I never thought of myself as a depressed person because I always thought I didn't have a good enough reason to. I was never physically abused but apparently I was mentally and I didn't even know it. On my father's side of the family is where the toxic comes from. Especially my father himself. My therapist explained to me what gaslighting is and it all made sense. My father had been doing that to me my entire life. For my birthday last year I made the decision to cut him off for good but it's been 19months since and I feel like shit for doing that. There's a lil 5yr old boy inside of me that desperately wants that father/son relationship but there's another part of me that knows it will never happen no matter how hard I try.

I've been struggling with reoccurring depressive episodes, self harm and suicidal ideations for years. I've gotten better, I'm genuinely content with my life and have an amazing partner, but I still struggle with depressive episodes. They aren't super severe, and I feel that I don't have any reason to be sad, I just am.
I just realized that I get sad because I'm sad, like I notice that I'm kinda sad and then that makes me sadder because I don't want to be sad. I am so fucking sick of dealing with depression.

Thanks for reading, just needed to vent a little","I realized why I'm sad ""for no reason""",1
887,"**\[SERIOUS, LONG\]** This is quite a long post as I felt the first step to recovery was to get it out of my system. So please bear with me.

Exactly a year ago, my (20M) sister(24F) died. It was too brutal for me. My parents were completely shattered and both actually went into a deep depressive episode. I saw that immediately and said to myself - 'Dude, you cannot get weak right now. Your parents need you more than ever'. So for the whole year, I did not even shed a single tear- in the hopes that my parents would see this and think that things are not completely lost.

This somehow worked. I've seen many parents who after losing their child stay depressed for years long. This, fortunately, wasn't the case in my parents. But it took a massive toll on me. Not crying during the day made my nights worse. I had terrible thoughts (what if my parents also died? Whether I had been a good brother to my sister? Did I make her proud?) which kept me up at night. And when the day dawned, I had to put on a smile in front of my parents.

While I was very happy that my parents were doing an amazing recovery, things kept going downhill for me. I actually couldn't study. Whenever I sat with my textbook open, the dark thoughts again crept my mind and I had to take a walk or just watch Netflix or something just to take my mind off it. I was really good at maths and logic before, but after this, it took me a full minute to do even some basic calculations. I am gonna be honest here, the only way I could sleep at night was to masturbate. It was never out of horniness. But because I just wanted to get some fucking sleep, I would masturbate and the release would put me instantly to sleep.

This had an even worse effect on me. The next morning, I would always beat myself over doing such veil things after my sister died instead of working to make her proud. Unable to study, my grades went drastically down. And being an electronics engineer trying to go into IT sector, not only the stacks were against me, but my GPA only made matters worse as I had the added dread over how I would survive in real-life. I thus had to resolve to cheat in tests. I absolutely hated this practice before and my sister who was a gem of a student never indulged into it. And I had made a promise to her that neither would I. But to stop this downfall, I had no option but to give into it and this makes me even sadder.

Before all this, I was in a perfectly good shape. But due to corona and online classes, physical activities became less and less. And so here I was - fat, depressed and someone, who is horribly ashamed of not being able to make his parents and sister proud and has his future all in tatters. Telling all this to anyone always felt like I was acting like the victim and making excuses, hence I never expressed it out. Hell even typing this is giving me huge pangs of guilts over victimizing myself. There is a deep voice in my head which is screaming at me. Saying how I am an ungrateful piece of shit. Just a big fat fuck, who would amount to nothing in life. I just hate myself.

I want to talk to someone. Reach out to someone who I can trust. But being the anti-social piece of shit that I am, I do not have any such friends to confide into (sure I have friends, but not close one) and hell no would I confide into my parents who are just healing themselves.

All this has made me into a bit of nihilist. I really don't see any point in doing anything as the thought that my life (the one that I had envisioned before all this) is already dead. I see no bright future. The dark voice inside me is proving too powerful. I hate myself and am always a mix of sad and angry and I an fucking tired of it now. I miss my sister so fucking much. I loved her more than me and my parents. I don't think I will ever find someone who I'll be loving as dearly as I loved my sister, and THAT makes me so sad.

I want to get better. I need to get better. I miss my old and happy parents. I miss my sister. I miss my old self - the one who had a nice physique, who was intelligent and had a proper goal in life. Everything is looking dark. Hate the world and me. I feel like I am no longer actually living. Every day feels like a jail to me. I am absolutely devoid of any compliments (only my sister used to give that to me). Even tho my parents are doing an amazing recovery, everyone is attributing that to them reading religious books. No one recognizes my pains, my sacrifices and it fucking hurts.

I just need to love myself again. Find myself again. Be myself again. Someone please help",Just can't stop hating and feeling sad for myself all the time,1
888,"I ended a 2 year long distance relationship with my bf half a week ago. He decided that he didn't want to reach to me anymore because he couldn't leave his job in his country. Within the span of our relationship I lost my friends and only kept contact with my only bestfriend but she also hasn't responded anymore since the start of the pandemic. I dropped out of college  before I met my ex because my heart wasn't really set on it. I felt like I wasted most of my time there. I had high grades but the pressure eventually gave me alot of anxiety- I was crippled by fear. I had panic attacks here and there. However, therapy was something I cannot afford. I'm not even sure myself if I have depression. 

My parents just don't understand no matter how much I explain so I gave up trying. At this point I just distract myself with video games but I'm getting tired of it too. Nothing else interests me anymore. My small business is getting affected already but I feel so infuriated and annoyed whenever I pressure myself to do the things I feel I'm obliged to. My mom keeps pushing me to get a job so she can earn for building their new house and that adds to the guilt because I really want to make myself busy with work and be less of a burden but I just couldn't bring myself to do other stuff. 

The guilt, the loneliness, the pain of losing the people I love, the pressure to achieve something at my age is getting too much. I don't know where to go from here without any source of comfort and it's suffocating to think I have to go on and on just barely living. I want to have new friends but I'm scared.

I failed a class and I’m about to fail another what use am I if I can’t do shit. I’m the ugliest fucking person alive I’m so gross.

894,"Throwaway account for reasons.  I posted this over in /r/offmychest however I think the mods removed (or never approved) the post.  Mods, if this shouldn't be here please delete it.

Over a year ago my closest buddy, confidant, best friend, etc. of 10 or so years died.  Well to be specific, I put her to sleep.  She wasn't doing well and she did live a long wonderful life that she would not have had otherwise.  Her organs were failing her, and I would never in a thousand years wish this feeling upon my most hated enemy.  Sitting with her as she passed, it destroyed me in ways I can't even describe.  I still feel deep emotional pain to this day that at times is distressing at best and debilitating at worse.

To help, I started looking for another Rottweiler.  But in my area, Rottweiler rescues are more convoluted than breeders and I despise it.  I shouldn't have to sign a contract stating that I am the caretaker of the dog and shoulder all liability and responsibility of said dog.  However, the rescue reserves ultimate say and may remove the dog for **any** reason.  Nor should I need to cause further harm to the population by going to a breeder.  And shelters? most shelters in this area act as an intermediate and only deal with rescues (for Rottweilers).  When I do find a shelter they are almost typically closed or they don't release to 'out of state' residents (even if the border is 3 min away).  

Then I get a ray of sun shine, a lead on a home that can't keep their two year old Rottweiler.  I reach out, all looks good.  Then the day of the meet and greet, I get 'sorry my kid is sick' after I've texted that I was on my way, now as I am driving I didn't check my text messages until I got to the destination.  Okay, that sucked and it triggered a massive depressive episode.  Thinking we would reschedule, I tried contacting the person.  However it seems that I was ghosted, no call, no text, nothing.  WTF?  After having genuine hope and excitement, it just destroyed me emotionally even worse.

At this point, I am emotionally drained.  I've seriously have thought about offing myself, I've thought of multiple ways to do so.  But I cannot leave my wife behind.  She is the reason why I still can wake up in the morning and try to be a functional member of society.   She is my second rock, however at this point, I have no emotional capacity left.  With COVID-19 f*cking up everything, any chance of rescuing a dog went out the window since the vast majority of shelters and rescues ceased adoptions and rescuing due to COVID-19.

Then the time I try to ask for help, I am told: 'Herr durr, go to a shelter you idiot' or 'If you can't afford to obtain a dog, you shouldn't have a dog' or 'what about long term expenses? how can you afford them if you are asking?'.  I am not asking for everyday care; that I can take care of.  It is the stupidity tax you need to pay for a Rottweiler that I can't afford.  Shelters/Rescues ~$500-$1000 + ungodly contracts + other insane restrictions. (No fence? Denied.  Live on the main road? Denied.  Too small of a house or other insane reason? Denied.)  Breeders cost between $500 and $3000, do I want to go to a breeder? Not really, but they don't stipulate insane contracts or have other stipulations.  

**Let me make this crystal clear.  A breeder is my last choice option and would greatly prefer a rescue or shelter dog** 

But you know what happened when I asked?  I got shat on.  I was told to **not** get a dog if I couldn't afford the initial cost.  Do people not understand that some folks actually need a dog for emotional stability? Others have other emotional support tools.  For me my dog was a key part of my emotional support network.

It pains me, I cry at night.  My wife asks me 'What's wrong?' and my response is nothing since I can't formulate a response of that a large piece of me is missing.  I can't even sleep in bed with my wife at night because my steady rock has been taken away from me.  Most nights I sleep alone in a recliner, most of the time it is due to my messed up my right shoulder.  However there are nights, I do so just to isolate myself from the depression.  And I love my wife dearly, yet it is something that I struggle with now.  Not having a Rottweiler is destroying me.  At home, my life is of depression and sadness.  With the end result of I am slowly killing myself internally.  Work is stressful to no end, I've snapped at my boss more times than I care to count.  I've even attempted to resign from my job, that is how bad it is.  As is, I've taken more sick time this year for mental health reasons than I have in the past 7 years alone.

I am already seeing a psychologist which I am not sure if it is helping or not.  Psychiatrists are currently impossible for me to see due to long wait times, etc.  I am on anti-depressants which help, I think.  But meds are not the end-all solution.  I know the only proper solution is to get another Rottweiler, but that leads back to a catch 22 situation.  I can't afford the startup, so I can't get one.  As I said, the on-going cost isn't of concern as that can be handled.",My dog's death a year ago still hurts like hell,1
895,"Let my preface this by saying that I'm on the autism spectrum, deal with ADHD, and suffer from anxiety and depression and goodness knows what else. Since graduating from high school in 2013, I have been in a constant wheelspin. In and out of community college, flunked out of a university program after one semester, and in various dead end jobs (including a position at a Michigan-based coffee franchise that left me so broken and soulless that I get slightly triggered whenever I walk past one, and have promised to kill myself if I ever have to work a job like that again). The only real progress I've made towards being a functional adult is that I know how to pay my taxes and moved into my own place with my girlfriend this year.

So I'm sure you can guess how I felt when I tapped open Instagram, saw the recommended accounts thing and accidentally clicked on one of my old classmates. Then another. And another for a good half hour before I just closed the app entirely and sulked in my chair, where I remain as I type this.

I know that it's social media, and it's meant to be someone's highlight reel of all the good moments in life, but they all looked so damn happy. Making progress in life. Graduated from a university with a degree that'll take them places. Working jobs that challenge and fulfill them. Adults. A part of me feels happy for them. 

But most of me? Most of me is left with the knowledge that 7 years have passed since I received my diploma, and I am still just waiting for my life to start. People tell me my time will come eventually, that someday I'll get everything sorted out and that now is just a blip on the radar, but... 7 years, a fucking quarter of my life, of constant attempts at college and a career later, and I can't shake the feeling it never will. What if this is all I have to look forward to in life? Forced to be miserable, holed up in an apartment that feels more like a prison than a home...

The thoughts that come after that are what really scare me, though. That I might as well end my life now so that I don't waste anybody's time or money just to be kept alive. I'll never amount to anything; might as well cut the world's losses. Not like the world's getting better, anyway. Even if it was, not like I'll see much of the benefits of it. If that's all life has for me, I might as well end it before it inevitably gets worse.

And I can't shake the feeling that those thoughts aren't entirely irrational. THAT'S what's leaving me paralyzed and on the verge of tears right now. It wouldn't be the first time; my girlfriend saw me cry my eyes out for the first time last night for the same reason. I don't want to make her cry at my funeral because I decided to cut my own life short, but I also don't want to hold her back from a life where she would be much happier than if she was with me.

I really don't want to die. I just want to be happy with my life. But I'm starting to think that may not be possible for me.","I looked at some of my high school classmates' Instagram accounts today, over 7 years after graduating...",1

Now when I eat anything that I enjoy, I feel bad about myself and almost guilty about behaving in a way that will have me gain weight. I welcome the hunger. I feel like a fake.

I have so much to do with work and school and internships that I'm paralyzed to do anything, which makes me feel like a waste of time and space. I can't even get up to eat, which is okay since it makes me feel some pain. I have so many missed deadlines that it seems almost pointless to try and catch up. But I at least finally found the energy, after hours, to get out of bed to use the restroom.

When I feel like this, all I want to do is detach and isolate. But I can't even do that because I live with my partner and a roommate. You'd think that would help but it's just overwhelming.

898,"First, time ever posting so this might be a bit of ramble, but I will try to be succinct. 

I've been depressed for more than half my life now (currently 29) and slowly but surely everything that used to bring me joy has been hollowed out. Don't get me wrong, I am not always miserable. I can find brief glimpses of ""happiness"" that distract me from my malaise but they are always so fleeting. The only reason I haven't ended my life yet is because of a promise I made to my father, but it is getting harder and harder to justify that each day. Each time I close my eyes I can see myself taking my own life. I just don't see the point of holding on to a life I don't enjoy. 

I know nobody is happy all the time - and maybe I am wrong - but I can't fathom everyone feeling this way as often as I do. I just feel like I need something concrete and more substantial to hold on to. Medicine, therapy, obligations and fleeting distractions are all I have now. Is the view of what life ""suppose"" to be I have formed wrong? Is it really nothing but distractions?

I think I set my standards too high, so I think I do worse than I actually do, but at the same time I'm certain that my ability to do use my full ability is hampered.

905,"A few days ago I had a couple of conversations with two people that I've known for a month now.
I will see them again in January, but I still would like to know how to explain this thing to them.
Maybe it's helpful to know how to explain it even to someone else.

Depression is an illness, right?
So why people can't understand that it's hard to get better.
Even if you realize what you need to do to get better you can still have moments where you aren't lucid. 
Where you think irrationally.

I can't explain to them that there are:
• moments where I don't think rationally
• moments where I am fully convinced that I'm thinking rationally, but I am not. I realize only after that I was thinking irrationally. I call them ""false rationality moments""
• moments where I (really) think rationally

The first ones I call them ""crisis""(in general, when I'm not sure they are panic attacks, maybe partial panic attacks), and when I'm having a crisis I act irrationally and I may think both rationally and irrationally. It's like I'm conscious that what I'm thinking and doing is irrational but don't have the strength to act against it.
I think this happens because somehow deep down I believe that something irrational is partially true, or it's the right thing to do for my wellbeing even if rationally, it isn't.

They said that okay I can't do much about irrational moments but I am able to prevent them. 
I am, right? 
No, not always. 
I wish I could erase the problem just by thinking that life is worth living. But I can't change what I am feeling, I can't change everything, I can't change my perceptions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's like when you have to study something you don't like, you study it because you have to. But you don't like it, you don't see the purpose of studying it, even studying out of pure curiosity drains your energy over time.
When you are reading nothing sparkles your curiosity, nothing adds to the initial statement ""ok let's see what is it"", and weighing up what you learnt with the time and energy you've spent you know that it wasn't worth it. 

With life the difference is that you must do it, you must live. It's tiring, and at some point you just want another sparkle to go on, currently I'm clinging to them, even if they fade away quickly.
I hope I will find something that makes me want to live again or at least makes me say ""it's worth the effort to get better"".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, even if I could change what I am feeling, they can't pretend that I cannot fall again in an irrational moment where I don't want to live anymore. I just can't, If I said ""yeah I will do it"" I would lie.
Just because I know I should live it doesn't change how my mind works, and if it does change, it' not overnight or a couple of hours. 

Even because sometimes I don't even know that the things I think aren't rational, but this is another story.



They got a bit angry against me, and I sincerely got scared. Sometimes I have flashbacks of the conversation that make me scared or guilty for a few seconds.
Two things came to my mind, and I wasn't able to explain them to them:
• the thing I said in this post
• the thing that I, in fact, do listen to them and to the advices they gave me.

If someone could help me figure out how to explain it, I would be grateful.

I have no friends to talk to this about because I don't really have any due to shitty life circumstances. 


My partner was diagnosed with major depression and post partum psychosis in January this year and its only been getting worse and harder. On the 31st of January my partner had a car accident with our daughter in the car, thankfully no one was harmed. Our daughter was only 3 months old at the time. The car was parked and approximately 5 metres away from the brick wall of the cafe I work in (i was working at this time). No one saw the accident but basically what happened is she turned the car on and a voice in her head said ""DO IT!"" and she floored it straight into the wall, smashed up the front end of the car and that was that. Shes been on anti depressants and olanzapine since then. They would have had her in the mental hospital had I not have taken months off of work to look after her and my daughter until mental health services discharged her and stopped coming to our house every couple of days.

My partner is like a hollow shell, she's not the same person I fell in love with years ago. She used to exercise,  play music,  be fun, independent and all around goofy and such a buzz to be around. Beautiful personality, gorgeous long blonde hair and very attractive to say the least. 



Our daughter is 15 months old now and she's running around,  talking and just being a happy little kid and my partner spends most of her day on her phone,  scrolling social media, staring at the wall, sitting on the couch and telling me that the energy in her body is not hers and she feels possessed pretty much. 
I work nearly full time, do all the housework,  cook all the food , wash dishes , dress and bathe our daughter,  everything.

 Life is fucking hard like this not going to lie, I've thought several times this year that I was just going to take my daughter and leave,  its been that bad. For all of February my partner was living in a fairy realm that she had created for herself as a means of protection from dark entities. I try my best to sympathise and support her but it feels pointless. She's always so numb.

The list goes on but I really need to get this off my chest. Anyone have a similar experience of being in a relationship with someone with severe depression?

I suffer from chronic insomnia as well as the depression so doing all this work of scheduling appointments, going to appointments, and coming back just to repeat the same process is grueling. I’m so tired all the time that I don’t even feel like doing any of the work. 

What is the next step here? Do I go see a psychiatrist? If so, how do I even schedule an appointment? It all seems like so much work and I just don’t want to do any of it",I Need Some Help,1
942,"Random thoughts in my mind is what you'll find here without organization. Thank you if you read through and offer advice. Im 19 years old and a first year college student.

I don't know if my life is just so unlucky always or I'm just only mentally noting the unlucky things that have happened to me. It's so tragic how almost everyone born in the 21st century is missing one or both parents in their life. I envy so much those who grow up and have 2 stable parents that love and support them unconditionally.

I just don't understand how you can live in this world without that type of emotional, mental, and financial safety net. My dad has been out of my life almost completely besides a few gaps here and there where he was on stable ground before falling into the endless pit of alcoholism. My mom doesn't even acknowledge my feelings at all or try to listen or understand to what I'm saying when I'm talking about how I feel.

This type of behavior from my mom has made me become a person that outsources all my emotional and mental needs to people I've never seen before online. The danger in this is that no one owes you anything online so people come and go so fast and just don't help because it's not their problem either. It's not even like I could try making real life connections with covid either.

I've felt for so long that a relationship would solve my problems and I'd stop feeling so shitty and useless everyday but I havent ever had one. Part of the reason is because it'd put my entire life worth into someone else which does more harm than good. The other reason is because I don't even put myself out there at all because I'm scared of everything for no reason.

I don't even have a safety net in my life anymore. My mom has been married to my mentally ill and delusional step father for years and I'll never be able to live in that house again. That's why I'm on campus during online college which makes no sense to waste that money. I have to pay for overpriced tuition find a way to make money to live, do well in classes, and find a way to not feel like killing myself everyday

Like at the end of the day literally nothing has a point or matters. Yet being in a human body you are programmed to keep going and not die and reproduce and that's it. Living is passive and death is active. Why can I never get myself to kill myself. Why must things go on.

Why must we live in a late stage capitalist society where our attention and psychology is used as a product that wires our brain to crave things that make us unhappy. Like theres no escape from a world that's designed to have so much stress and terribleness. 

Why do people prioritize physical health over mental health

I'm so unproductive and I can't accomplish anything. I'm such a YouTube addict where it's the only place where I can distract myself from my own thoughts and not think about killing myself. It's sad that we live in a society where weed is the only thing that will make you want to actually enjoy your life. 

If only I was a female where males jump all over you and give you exactly what you want. I wonder why male suicide rates are so much higher hahahhahahaahhahahaha. Males are so unhelped and downplayed to experience no feelings but here we are killing ourselves left and right.

Is suicide even a problem I don't know. It may just be good that we escape this simulated life. I don't even know why I feel sad all the time. I don't know why I feel worthless or feel so suicidal. It's just always been a part of me for as long as I can remember. Everything about this world just makes me feel that way. If only people would start caring about each other instead of money and meaningless shallow attention

That's the end. Could go on but I have no clue what I'm even talking about. I can't materialize how I feel while making sense. I don't know if I even want to get out of this hole or just have some type of euthanasia. Thank you for reading this far. I love you",Life's a Dungeon,1

944,"I feel done, I am gay and I get to points where I just don’t wanna live anymore, it’s all too confusing and it hurts. 
I have been told this by family 
No one is born gay, it’s a feeling and you choose to act upon it, just because you think of killing someone doesn’t make you a murderer. God made us a certain way, and being gay is a sin etc. Comparing being gay to over eating. I have also struggled with self harm for 5 years now. Not to mention I have been groomed and after that I would start giving my body away to anyone that wanted It...
I stopped self harming cuz I was caught and they took it all away. I still hurt myself sometimes, but I have someone who gets sad when I do so I don’t because I don’t wanna hurt them. I don’t really care about myself, I feel like a deserve to be in pain.
 It hurts and it gets to the point I just don’t want to live anymore. I feel like a sin even though I am told that they love me not my sin “hate the sin not the sinner” this phrase don’t make it better, makes it fucken worse. It still affects me knowing I could love someone and still be told it’s sinful for just loving someone. So, I just feel like killing myself, either way I commit a sin, I might as well not be in pain anymore.
I won’t kill myself because I don’t want to hurt anyone, but I don’t enjoy life.

946,"Hi all, I don’t have any friends I can speak like this to so I want to start by saying thanks for having this space on Reddit for me to say what’s in my head.

I’ve never truly felt happy and have lived a life of doing what society tells me is right rather than what feels right for me. I go through the motions with a fake smile on my face.

I’m male, raised by my mom and her sisters basically, who all openly dislike men. I hated myself because I knew I’d grow up to be one. On top of it, I’m gay, and from a small town where that’s not ok either. I’m so uncomfortable in my own skin because of it, I automatically assume anything about me will be off putting to others. I won’t even play music around people I know for fear they’ll make fun of my taste, since I don’t have much luck being accepted.

Love and companionship are such foreign concepts to me. I’ve never felt love or known what it feels like to have someone want to be my partner. I’m not sure I’m capable of it because of how little I like anything about myself. In theory finding love could be a big step toward happiness for me. Maybe if I like someone who enjoys life, it’ll make me enjoy life? Give me a reason to wake up in the morning? But I genuinely don’t think I’m capable of any of that. I have friends that have known me for years and they’ve never even been in my house. I’m not a hoarder and I don’t have dirty secrets, I just have awful anxiety about anyone being in my space or seeing me intimately.

Last summer I had major heart surgery to replace a valve. It came up suddenly as effects of a birth defect started to show. Complications had me in the hospital for a month and I had a total of 3 surgeries before being released. My small bubble of family and friends were horrified, and I noticed they cared so much more than me. My time there made me realize I was ready to die because it was a solution to this problem I have where I can’t figure out how to live. I left almost disappointed that now I have to learn how to continue living while also handling the overwhelming stress of my new scar and tick (from the metal valve). 

I can’t be in silence anymore. I turn on the shower if I’m using the toilet. Music is always playing if I’m awake. A fan is loudly blowing by my face when I sleep. All as a desperate attempt to drown out my chest, which sounds like an old wall clock.  It’s like the world said to me “oh you hate life now? Wait until we make it super inconvenient for you with a noisy chest!” It was a cruel trick. I wish I could just close my eyes, the ticking would stop, and I’d never wake up again. It’s be such a release from this failed attempt at life I’ve been trying to make work but just can’t. 

I’ve tried to find passion in life to give me something to be happy about. A career change, a hobby, maybe buying a house? None of them work out. I just don’t care about anything and can’t trick myself into it. I wish I could gift wrap my life into a box and give it to someone who can put it to better use, because I’m defective and my parts could be best used elsewhere.

So I'm pretty much on my own despite my periodically messages about finding some time to hang out online. 

This being alone is driving me to points where my PA is getting back to what it once was.

&amp;#x200B;

I've thought long and hard about where and how to start this post, and I think the best place to start is late 2016. I had just moved back to my home state after a year of essentially being home sick. Lived with my family for a bit, met a girl, and we dated until January of 2019. The majority of this time was great. I had two jobs (I always have, since 18, I enjoy working and staying busy, also had to pay off a lot of student debt) and lived with my SO, always was busy outside of work, hanging with friends and what not. For the most part until the very end, I was incredibly content with everything. I have always been the kind of person who feels better when I'm busy. I don't think it's so important about \*what\* it is most of the time, but more so if I feel productive and/or if I am with good company. I've always had that in my life to be honest. Until recently I've always had a large circle of friends, which was never the case thinking back to, lets say, high school. But all was well...I was seeing someone I loved, it was reciprocated, I enjoyed both my jobs (professional job and a job in a restaurant) we were both well off financially, all of my friend groups where whole, etc. I had few complaints, in retrospect. 

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of 2018 and early in 2019, I started to pick up on my SO's tendency to talk down to me. It wasn't so much \*what\* was said, but \*how\* it was said. Argumentative, abrasive, almost as if she thought she had 'control'. To be very clear, I've \*\*never\*\* felt that way I wholeheartedly believe in two people being a team and communicating. I've never talked towards and SO like that. I would work a few days a week about 14 hours or so, come home around 10PM and essentially, sometimes be talked down to. At this point I am about 26 years old and I'm a very forward thinking person, I'm thinking about ""forever"" and what not, and I didn't want to feel trapped in a marriage where that occurs. I have never yelled at an SO, called an SO a name, anything of that sort, and I didn't believe it was fair. It was discussed a couple times, but never changed. Again I want to be clear...it wasn't this way from the beginning. It wasn't the same girl I fell for. It's like she became comfortable and would generally see how far she could ""push"" it verbally. We split up in January of 2019 and at the time as much as it sucked, I didn't feel 'depressed' or anything similar. Things were better after that, not worse. I got my own place, I paid off all my student debt, I still was occupied outside of working hanging with friends and what not, for the majority of 2019. All of 2019 was mostly me working as much as I used to, getting into dating and such and doing things that I enjoy with friends. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here I'll start to provide some context on what was my close friend group in the second half of 2019. Again, there were a decent amount of friends, but I don't believe I spent more time with anyone than these three. We'll call my first male friend B. I've known B for \~6 years. We have been hanging out and going out on weekends ever since I moved back from Florida, \*religiously\*. We \*never\* argue. It always just worked. He knows a ridiculous amount of people, which is a large portion of the reason I myself know as many people as I do now in the first place, which I'm happy for, really, I've met some great folks. My only criticism, and I generally don't care...but B cares more about quantity of friends than quality. Social media is top priority.  Posts, likes, how many people we see, etc. I'm not particularly like that, and I can generally get by it if we're together. That's his prerogative. It doesn't affect me. It worth nothing that B has also gotten physical if we are out at night together, not terribly so but stiff arms here and there and he's got about 100lbs on me, so frankly, it's a bit of a joke, and generally over nothing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The second friend here I'll call R. R isn't from here. R moved here and dated B for a short amount of time. In all honestly, he wasn't so great to her. I've been very vocal to B (mostly sarcastically) about how he finds someone, dates them for two weeks, then makes up some ridiculous reason as to why he can't see them or just disappears. Again, his prerogative, I just think it's ridiculous and exhausting. B also told me a lot of very personal things about R that frankly, he shouldn't have. I never said much because I don't want to spread more rumors or even facts that others shouldn't know, it's just bad behavior. Anyway, R and I hung out a decent bit for about a year or so independently on and off. We would chat We got along. I actually introduced her to some of my friends from high school and such. After dating B (for that short period of time) R was always involved with several individuals at once. She would vent and complain to me via text, phone calls, face time, what have you and I would always listen and provide my opinion, if she asked and/or if it mattered. I won't give myself a whole lot, but I'll listen, and I always did. I always answered the phone and put up with a hysterical R that no one else would put up with. 

&amp;#x200B;

The third person here we'll call W. W goes back about as far as B does. B introduced me to W. B also introduced me to R, so essentially, these two females I know via B. I had always known of W, we never talked much, never hung out independently, would sometimes see her, what have you. So the four of us are all friends, all is well. We hang out, sometimes all four, sometimes just two or three, there's no issues whatsoever. This is where my biggest regret now lies...

&amp;#x200B;

....W and I dated. It started sort of as a joke with B about ""you guys should date"" and we all laughed it off for maybe a month or two. But we're both mature. I'll be honest, I don't think B and R are mature at all. Whole separate story, but generally, they're not. We had fun the couple times we'd hang out. Conversation was organic and normal. I asked W out on a date. We went and it was fine. We went on a second and it was totally fine, enjoyable. This isn't a secret to anyone, and B and R tell everyone everything (I've learned to say less now, trust me) so this went on for months. And when I say ""this"", I mean it was me giving this 'relationship' whatever I had, with little reciprocation. There was no label. There was no affection. There wasn't even civil conversation half of the time. W is incredibly rude and abrasive. I honestly don't think I entirely blame her, she has dated some awful individuals and I believe that unfortunately plays into it all. I tried to understand as best I could, really, I did, but there's always yelling, snide comments, etc. I gave essentially all I had mentally to someone with little to no reciprocation (that was evident at least) for the first half of 2020. In retrospect, I don't know why. I saw who she \*could\* be and how she \*could\* act but the rude comments and rude behavior would always occur more often than I've ever dealt with before. But 90% of the time I let it go. To provide context, this whole time I was going to her place exclusively, never mine as she had animals. I'd walk her dog when she was at work. We would go out to eat. I would talk to her at any and all times, and listen to her vent, because I genuinely did care. We traveled a bit locally later on, did sightseeing. I introduced her to my parents. I introduced her to friends. Despite all of this, our exchanges were often filled with ""You don't actually like me"" and ""you're not a happy person"" and other demeaning comments like that. To be clear, I \*\*did\*\* tell her about my previous relationship where I didn't appreciate how things were said. This turned into not only how things were said, but also what was said, so it was even worse. Yet I persisted. Eventually we officially dated for a short period of time, but the rude comments and dismissal of how I felt continued. I would get multiple texts a day, she even showed up at my place once while I wasn't home. I have tried beyond that point (I don't know why, to be truthful) to fix this but I couldn't seem to do it with rational discussion. I saw someone with so much potential as a person, but who so often is her own worst advocate, either with actions or rude words towards others. (This isn't unique to me, she talks negatively about everyone, but not my issue entirely) We were together for maybe about a month or so, which is being generous. Again, I'm forward thinking, and I don't think I could go a \*\*single day\*\* without a snide comment, wondering where I am, suggesting I wasn't being loyal, mad I wasn't responding quickly enough, etc. I've never done any of these things. In short, for about 6-9 months I was mentally giving someone my all and getting little to nothing in return. To be clear, I've now removed W off of all social media / blocked her. It was quite toxic and I'm trying my best to let it remain in the past. 

&amp;#x200B;

I broke it off, a couple times, for very obvious reasons. I'm 28 now, my intent isn't to casually date for long periods of time, but as you can imagine, it gets worse and others get involved. As I mentioned previously, R isn't from here. She gravitated to our friend group quite hard because of this. \*\*totally fine.\*\* I don't blame her. But her and W would hang out a lot, also fine. But she would continue to send me pictures when they were out, and talk to me about it. I mentioned (which should be obvious) that I don't really want to hear about it and/or see pictures, because the situation with W was less than ideal, and honestly bothered me at the time. You'll remember that I said she would always call and text me with problems to vent about, or crying, and I'd listen. To someone that I knew for such a short period of time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Her response when I asked her to stop sending me pictures and stop reminding me of the whole scenario? \*""Get the fuck over it""\* I don't know if this is someone thinking that the 'hard talk' is most effective, or someone just being tone deaf, but W and I always had the discussion (since we were previously friends) that we would eventually get alone, we'd just need time apart if things didn't work out. I explained how this wasn't really even her business, she has no context (because I didn't provide any and I \*\*know\*\* W didn't she never liked involving others into her personal life) and that she was being irrational. She doubled down on that. She never apologized, addressed it, etc. I've seen her once since. She pretended essentially that it never happened. We don't talk anymore regularly because R is dating someone seriously, but I don't see it as beneficial to be treated that way, not only by a friend, but someone who's known me less than a year and believes that sort of behavior is acceptable. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now we'll get onto B. B has talked to W about 'us' several times, with myself present or not. I've explicitly addressed this several times, to please not talk about what \*we\* talk about to W, and he'll go turn right about and tell her. Even if we're all together. 5 minutes later. I've had several individuals start yelling at me because B decided to start talking to everyone with minimal context and stir the pot, for lack of a better word. B has interpreted to ""Please don't talk about things that aren't your business"" as ""stop being involved with me"" and seemingly avoids hanging out now. We used to watch football, go out, do things and now it's just ""I'm busy"", with W and R or not. To be clear, I don't mind seeing these people, I can tolerate them, I just want things to be normal again. But he seemingly takes it upon himself to determine who hangs out with who, even know no one asked that of him. I've watched him do this to other friends of ours who dated and split, and 'picked favorites' if you will, and that is seemingly what's happening now. 

&amp;#x200B;

 I've helped B at will for years. I've written documents for him to be used in court, to help out a friend. We've hung out for years with no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

I hung out with R independently for a year or so, listened to her vent and console her. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most importantly, I fell for W and I don't even know why, while she simultaneously treated me beyond poorly, and no one else was around to observe or understand it. Not my friends, or my parents, no one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*""this just sounds like r/relationships!""\*

&amp;#x200B;

That's just the larger issue IMO, there's more....

&amp;#x200B;

I've been employed at the same large company for four years now. I used to love it. I love going to work, I enjoy working, but I'm currently work from home and I cannot stand it. The line of work I am in, I cannot accomplish anything (seemingly) and human interaction is needed to accomplish work most of the time. I have never been less motivated, honestly, in my entirely life. My company also fired hundreds of people and combined my job with another job for no extra pay. Within a week I went from being okay with my job, to totally hating it. I've rarely ever felt this way, but I don't even want to get out of the bed in the morning. I am eating less, and I hate it. I have no motivation to do \*\*anything\*\*. To be clear, I am generally always one to ""do something"" about my problems, so I'm interviewing extensively, it's just gone nowhere thus far. I truly do not think that with my current responsibilities, I'll ever be happy at this company again, which hurts to say. I had a second job at a restaurant that in the normal world, pays really well. I was repurposed and I only made hourly, but I stayed (and am still technically an employee) because it was something to do, got me out of the house, and eventually, I'd like my old job back. Reservations have declined to much they don't need me anymore and I'll go back once things pick up, I just don't know when that is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly, I hate my apartment. My lease is up in January and I'm about to end it and move closer to the city (I genuinely enjoy being near everything) but paying more money, even though that makes me nervous. I haven't had a single income in ten years, and although I think I can do it, it frustrates me. I'm just at the point where I don't think I can be reasonably happy here, which I know is more important than money. I wake up, walk 10 feet to my 'desk' and do my job that I absolutely despise now. Going to restaurant used to be my escape for 3-4 hours, even though the pay was literally nothing compared to my salary. 

&amp;#x200B;

My friends are either working on weekends when I'm not, married with kids (I understand that) or just flat out suddenly avoiding meeting up, because I dated a friend. I go weeks without anything to do or anywhere to go. The gym in my apartment complex is closed and has been since March. I live in an odd area where I don't really have sidewalks so I can't walk or jog very far, and it's getting to be near freezing here now. My family has noticed quite quickly that I'm very unhappy. I've been honest with them about this an explained it as best I can. They're cognizant of this, but to be honest it's not a fix. I can't replace all of my time with friends with family time, we haven't ever been that way as a family. I don't want to move back with them either. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am generally always a person with an idea or a plan and I don't have one right now and it's ruining every single day. I honestly wish I could find new friends but it's difficult currently for obvious reasons, and I've been with the same friends for so long that I haven't had to consider this in nearly a decade. I have fewer people than ever to talk to, fewer than ever to hang out with, I dislike my job vehemently as well as my apartment, which now are the same damn place. I'm burning up my vacation so I work three day weeks now and otherwise, I just lay around. I have no motivation to do anything, no appetite, and I want to hang with friends but seemingly can't, for reasons out of my control. I've thought about another temporary job, or volunteering, but I don't know what to do. Most importantly I want to meet new people because I'm afraid that I became too dependent on people who truly didn't care as much as they seemingly did, but I'm unsure how in today's current climate. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've revised this many times in an effort to make it as clear as possible, but I'm sure it's still not, so apologies there. Any suggestions / kind words are appreciated.","Unsure why I'm even posting, maybe I just need to vent...",1

967,"Been in previous relationships, I've been with people that either had an interest in me or I had an interest in them. But I never experienced something as amazing as I did.

Break ups happen and they're rough. She had told me she's not ready for a relationship, and that maybe In future with me and that she still loves me. With that, we ended on good terms and continue being friends.

But it feels like something died. She has no interests with me at all, romantic interests were expected to die, but she barely even treats me as a friend. The hardest part is knowing she doesn't care anymore, and because of this I don't know how to move on.

During the breakup I had told her that I may want to avoid being friends with her cause I'll be hurt and it would be my process of healing. She fought and convinced me to stay as ""friends with benefits"". My friend group is also hers, and leaving her would mean leaving them.

968,"Not sure where to write this on. I don't know if I'm depressed, maybe seasonal depression but I've never had a diagnosis (did therapy for a few weeks- weekly sessions, before quitting due to money concerns), but I just feel like a blank canvas.

As a 19 year old, I have no knowledge of anything I like- and it's been making me cry for weeks. No motivation to figure things out either. I feel lost, and forcefully unmotivated to figure my way out. It's frustrating because the last two months it feels like I've laid in bed and cried over the same thing- not knowing myself.

I don't know any hobbies I like- everything is boring. I try to write, then I get into this rut of not wanting to use the word ""I"" (which has been used a lot). Then it stresses me out because I hate using that word, and not fond of doing things unless it's for others (writing included). I feel egotistical and narcissistic. Then music, the same artist has been playing on my Spotify for the past 5 years. My clothing are all clothing that was bought for me when I was 15, and I haven't bought anything since.

Clothing wise, I've always thought ""oh I'm just going to lose all the weight, don't want to buy new/nice things for myself until I'm at my goal weight"", now here I am. I admit, a little less weight but the same size clothing after 4 years.

And hobbies, I have none. No talents, no nothing. I enjoy kayaking, but it's the middle of fall and I don't have my own car to transport my kayak. I use to walk every night, but I don't seem to have energy anymore. Mostly because during my walks I would listen to music but now I hate music because I hate the same fucking albums each time I walk. 

I recently threw almost all but three outfits away, cancelled Spotify (no more music). But now it feels like I just forced myself to lay in bed all day rewatching the same Netflix shows. Waiting for a friend to text, but I don't have anyone. 

I'm so damn lost and frustrated. Any advice how to get out of this rut? Because I feel so stuck and it's killing me. I don't want to lay in bed anymore and wait for a nonexistent friend to pop into my life, or a magical talent to pop into my veins.

We had bo contact for 2 months, and I cared for her again when she got abandoned, so we came back together and lived in my apartment for nearly one year, then she got her own apartment. Then she wanted to be best friends with me instead of partners, and I agreed, because I didn't want to lose her completely. We went on, I got a job, we met up nearly every day, but because I am still an apprentice I sometimes need to sleep at my ""school"".

And yeah, what I don't know doesn't fuck up my thoughts, but I got that this guy, which abandoned her in a really shit situation, was at hers. I know it because of several pictures. I wanted to talk about this but yeah, not much answers.

I read her personal notes, and there were 3 sites just about that guy, and no word from me, althrough she's by my side nearly every day. 
It's a sword into my heart, I try to be nice to her, and it was nice to be with her and doing stuff with her. We cooked together when I was at home, we played games together, we drank together.

Truth be told I feel nothing and when I do it’s pain, and that’s truly the only thing alive in me anyway. I am moody, I hate myself and I take it out on others who don’t even deserve it. Plus I’m failing my sophomore year of college and have 10k in student loans, I’ve also dropped 5 credits worth of classes. Nothing is going right anyway, I’m 20 years old and I can’t even grow the fuck up, I’m 20 years old and I can’t even drive yet.... My family thinks I freeload being that I’m failing and don’t do much in the house or have a job and it’s true. I got an ultimatum to move out or get my shit together and that is what I plan to do before going. 

First I am getting my license and applying to a job which should all get done by this month, in this same month I will be finishing up school and trying to pull together passing grades to appease my family. 

When December comes I’ll be able to drive, I plan to visit my friends a few times, spend a lot of time with family and our dogs. I don’t want to argue needlessly with anyone, I want them to have good memories before I go. I’m going to give them the best memories. 

Now on December 25th, Christmas, I will be giving my old dearest camera to my best friend and tell her that I’m getting a new one anyway and I thought it would be special for her. I’d make sure to give her plenty of film so we can take our last photos. Christmas also happens to be my sisters birthday so I’ll have a special card made for her and a hand made painting (I’m a good artist imo). My mom will get a painting as well, and a sweet card with flowers, she loves flowers. I have gifts for everyone else too that are valuable but I’ll keep that to myself.

On the 26th I’m going to take everyone out on a treat day, (my nieces, nephew and sister, mom, all of them) and we will have a blast. 

As for my social media my friend has my passwords, I’ll have three drafts on Instagram she can post once I am gone. All of my other accounts and histories will be removed on December 29th. I plan to post a bit more frequently in the days leading up. 

Now in New Years when it all happens.... I’m usually with my family or friends. This time I’m telling my family that I’m going to drive to a friends house to sleep over. I will tell that friend that I can’t make it to her place and that I’ll be home. Both my family and friend will be clueless trust me lol. I’ll treat that day like any other New Years, with all the same empty hopes and aspirations as last year. Anyway, I’m going to park somewhere pretty and quiet, hopefully it will be where I can watch the fireworks for one last time.

Despite planning to do such an ugly thing, I want to see something beautiful before I go. 

I will write my letter in the car, filled with apologies and my wishes of course. I would like my body to be cremated and I want my ashes to to be poured into or by a river or ocean (still deciding that part) I just want it to be in a scenic place, and maybe if there is an afterlife I can stare up at the stars where I lay, or whoever comes to visit in the future can watch themselves. 

The way I plan to go I will keep to myself but I can promise you it will be quick and clean. I don’t want to make a mess of a car that was gifted to me, especially since it can be sold after I’m gone. All my money in my bank will be transferred to my shared bank account with my mom and my wishes will be for the money to go to my body being cremated/ funeral expenses. As for my students loans, I’ve researched that they are canceled, so all in all they won’t be burdened financially.

Now back to that day, of course after my supposed sleep over with my friend my family will be expecting me back. Eventually they will find out from my friend that I was never there, all of them will most likely ask around. And about ten minutes before actually doing the deed, I will have my location shared on my Snapchat. My friend does not use Snapchat a lot and no one else in family does either so I know they won’t ask me why I’m at the park before I’m gone. I know these people too well. 

Anyway I want them to have a great normal New Years so the day after when they are curious to where I am, sure enough my best friends will check my location on Snapchat. If not I’m sure my body will be found in no less than a week. 

That’s about it. Do you think there are any other details I should work out or fix? I feel like I’m missing something and I’m not sure what... any advice (besides the ones telling me not to because I am regardless) would be appreciated. Thanks!

She initiated it due to her overhearing me angrily vent to our parents about how fed up I was about manipulative and abusive things that she has continuously done to me for years, and how she has made no effort at all to change her ways. Once she inserted herself into our conversation it all went downhill from there. She threatened me, called me names and then physically attacked me. Both of our parents had to intervene and it took both of combined efforts to pull her off of me and get her to stop. She’s larger than I am in both weight and stature, and she could’ve hurt me pretty badly had she not been stopped when she was. (This has actually happed to me before btw, and I was left with two black eyes and a busted lip) As a result of her actions, I had to call the police. 

While on the phone she continued calling me names, cussing me out, making threats, and even threw my previous history of mental health struggles and suicide attempts in my face to further insult and humiliate me. She even went as far as to say that she didn’t care if I called the cops, and that I was crazy, and how no one would believe me. She continued by saying that both of our parents would back her up. 

During all of this, I was gaslit our parents. I was basically called a traitor for calling 911, and told that I had no family loyalty. My sister and I are both grown adults, and yet they made excuses for her actions, and downplayed them by referring to what took place tonight as “typical sibling rivalry” instead of acknowledging it as domestic violence. They said that I tried to ruin her life and should be ashamed of myself for getting “the man” involved in family business. They refused to see her actions as abusive, and instead felt it necessary tell me how horrible I am for not just letting her beat the shit out of me and getting over it. After some pleading from our parents, my sister was given a warning and not arrested, which admittedly I’m somewhat relieved about as I don’t want her to have a criminal record. However, I don’t want to be beaten anymore and feel unsafe in my home. A part of me feels like that this is all going to happen again and nothing will be learned from it. My entire family hates me now and I’ve never felt more alienated in my entire life.

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.","New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",1

It mostly sprouted from the general idea that I had to be good at school, My education oriented family made me unwillingly tell them that I wanted to become a doctor when my true dream is to become an actor. I have not told them the truth due to the fact that they would be very disappointed in me.

1. i lost someone to suicide on september 21st 2017 and it ruined me. i cared for him and he was a really funny guy.
2. bullying. for 3 years after his death i got bullied endlessly for doing stuff i had NO FUCKING CONTROL OVER.
3. suicidal thoughts happened a year after his death where i straight up said to a bully ""i don't want to live sometimes because of you, and the BEST FUCKING PART?! HE LAUGHED, SMILED, AND SAID ""GOOD FOR YOU"" WHILE CLAPPING."" 
4. school. i'm so far fucking behind i TRY MY FUCKING BEST! I'M SO WEAK AND PATHETIC I CAN'T EVEN GET A FUCKING A! MY FAMILY FUCKING PRIORITIZE GRADES OVER EVERYTHING ELSE AND I FUCKING HATE IT.
5. mental health issues mainly, like depression, anxiety, and insomnia. i only get an hour of sleep at night sometimes and sometimes i don't even fucking sleep.
6. i believe i have bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder but my family disagrees.

1195,"One week ago I sent a mail to somebody I wanted to get to know. He never had to chance to open it.

This fall I enrolled in uni. Kinda lonely, but w/e. Everybody is. Have my usual friend circle so everything is okay. Some of my subjects (CS) require student reference group members, and after none of us wanted to do it for this one glass, one guy did. He looked kinda shy in his profile picture but he wrote in a fun way and seemed to be a enjoyable guy, with friends hanging out with him in his banner on facebook. Every 3 weeks they were required to take in feedback from the rest of us and pass on to the lecturer, and he always wrote in a funny snippet for each google poll he would submit. One week ago I wanted the lecturer to go over a certain topic again, as myself and others were struggling with it. I could've just sent the mail myself directly to the lecturer, but the the guy('Joe') seemed fun so I sent him a message and asked him to ask for me. 3 days passed and I didnt get a reply from him, I assumed he forgot it. I then decided to send that mail myself, to the lecturer and got a reply instantly.

Today, I received an email from the school faculty.
'Greg' had passed away the day before before I sent that email. It was never read. I was shocked.

Why?

I went on his page and his mother had written an obituary. I was heartbroken. He was always smiling in every picture, and seemed like a really enjoyable guy. His youtube channel was linked on his instagram, and he was subscribed to alot of the same channels I was, and looked to like alot of the same games aswell. He even had his MyAnimeList on there, the mad lad liked alot of the same stuff I did...

I am so bummed out right now, I never even knew him besides reading his 'obligatory' posts on our student facebook page. We would've had so much to talk about...

So please, if you are on this subreddit for the wrong reasons dont do it. If I feel like this I cant even fathom how those that actually knew him, and were in those pictures with him smiling alongside him feel right now.

I'm 19Nb and I've struggled with depression the larger half of my life. At the beginning of this year I was diagnosed with Bipolar II as well as PTSD and Anxiety. This year has been the worst year of my life. My dad completely bailed on my high school graduation even when he promised he'd be there. My (now) ex girlfriend cheated on me at the beginning of the year and then just last month broke up with me. I ended up in the hospital at the beginning of September for a really bad panic attack and just recently I was diagnosed with covid. Not only am i physically isolated from the world right now but I'm also being socially isolated by my friends. The majority of them are always too busy to talk even though they've always reassured me that they'd be there for me and make time for me. All but one or two completely ghost me and even the ones that don't will barely talk with me. I'm really struggling with my girlfriend breaking up with me because to me, she was The One . We've been together for over 3 years and she moved from Hawaii to be with me in Minnesota. We've known each other for almost 5 years and she has genuinely saved my life. I'm so incredibly heartbroken to the point that I feel it may actually be killing me. I cant sleep without having nightmares about her, i can't deal with the stress of missing her so much, and i want nothing more than to get back together with her. She only cheated on me because i was a scummy piece of shit who was abusive to her. I never learned how to deal with my feelings as a child and instead of talking through things and dealing with them like an adult, I took things out on her in the form of anger. I hate myself for it. I genuinely can't love myself for what I've done to her and put her through. My heart hurts because I want nothing more than to heal the pain and hurt I caused and make her happy like I used to. I want to make her happy. I want to help her heal. I want to shower her with the love that I've felt for her this whole time. I never wanted to hurt her or cause her pain because she's the only thing in my sad pathetic life that has ever made me happy. And now I feel completely gutted, like I have nothing left to make me happy. I can't ever be happy with myself because of the remorse I feel for my actions. I feel like the most disgusting person and feel like what I did to her was the worst thing ever. I genuinely feel like I should die because of the pain i caused her. I feel selfish for wanting her love, even though deep down that's the only thing I want in life. I want to die because I feel like I have no value left in my life without her. The only value I had was to make her happy and to love her, doing those things gave me happiness, her love for me gave me happiness. We still talk and have contact so she hasn't just cut me out completely. She's expressed that she still loves and cares about me. The only hope I have left is the hope that we may get back together, that's the only thing keeping me going at this point. If i had no hope in that, i probably would have killed myself as soon as she broke up with me. I feel like it's so hard for my therapist to understand just how much I love her and how heavily this is affecting me. I feel like nobody really truly knows the pain, the remorse, the heartbreak, and the love I'm truly going through. I've always called her my sunshine, like the ""you are my sunshine"" song, and if she were to be taken away from me, that would be the day my life would end.

Such small insignificant things can ruin my whole day. I’ve already ruined so many countless days for myself. I can read one silly Reddit comment or one irrational thought. That’s all it takes to push me down. That one bad thought or comment will make me feel self-conscious throughout the whole day and keeps me from talking. I’m also sensitive as hell. If I speak in a group chat and no one responds, I will dwell on it for hours with the thought as I’m not liked. Deep down I know I have friends that care yet I still feel alone. I KNOW I have friends, yet I feel like I have no friends (I can’t explain this feeling). I feel my heart hurting everyday. That “pain, pressure, tightness” physical feeling in my chest.

I find it hard to believe that anyone is really happy or comfortable in this world that we've constructed. And I feel very much a little bit hopeless because I'm not sure it's even possible to fix myself without fixing the entire societal structure that I'm being forced to live in. How is it possible to be really content with your life under these circumstances? Are most people just literally lying to themselves every day about wanting to live, or have they somehow adapted to living like this? 

I feel like everyone I know hates being alive at least a little bit, whether they explicitly admit it or not. And it really makes me wonder what's the fucking point of even trying to get better.

1223,"1. They wrongly say they ""help"" you

Why do I say that? The truth is that they are not going to help you in any way if you are suicidal. If you only have a couple of mental issues, like anxiety or something like that, perhaps they will help, but if you tell them you are suicidal, they will only ruin you. They will call the police as if being suicidal was a crime. Your words are not confidential in the least. If you tell the therapist that you are having suicidal thoughts, that will certainly go into a mental health record. The precedent of you being suicidal will follow you for the rest of your life. Thus, that ""help"" only made things worse.

2. They are not your friends

Do you know why they are therapists?  They are therapists because that is a profession. Perhaps if the so-called ""therapists"" were a volunteer or were giving free appointments, then it would be more credible that they want to help you, but the truth is that they make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year out of your problems.

3. They are not confidential and don't give two craps about your life

Even a ""professional"" therapist will talk about you with their peers. Either because they find your case unusual or because they need help finding out what's wrong with you/ A less professional therapist will talk about you even with their partner or their friends, so why even bother telling a ""confidential"" person. I'm pretty sure you would have more privacy if you went to tell your case on Dr.  Phil. 

4. They don't understand you

Do you know what is the biggest lie a therapist will say? ""I understand you""... They don't understand any of us at all. A therapist does not know anything about your life, and they do not understand your problems. 

5. They are against suicidal people

If you are suicidal, don't even bother seeing a therapist. The moment you tell them about your suicidal thoughts, they will call the police and the mental hospital. They will only make you feel like being suicidal is wrong. They will make you feel like you don't belong in this society just because of your suicidal tendencies. That's because they will only think you are a weirdo and a creep for feeling that way. Believe me, I've been there.

Mother died this year, and things haven’t been great since. I dropped out of college after it happened, and father started drinking more. Became emotionally abusive, and never helps with any ordeal. Truly is making things worse.

Recently, my best friend just tried to commit suicide and I was the only one there to stop him. He Is now admitted into a psych ward, on his parents behalf. I’ve checked in with him once, says he is doing better but. I don’t know how much I’m led to believe. I’d like to think I did the right thing but, idk anymore.

It’s hard to have the courage to reach out and ask/tell him its gonna be okay. I feel like everything in my life is only getting worse and I’m finally cracking. That maybe he was right. But my natural human instinct wanted to save him. And the past three days ive been looking in the mirror hating myself. The pain I feel, and the sense that maybe suicide is the option. 

No girlfriend, no mother, a drunk unavailable father, no siblings, and now my last best friend. What if this is really the end for me. Alone in the world. So much pain at night. Crippling and painstaking days. Uncomfortableness in my own body. My own head. Screaming and yelling at my own thoughts. 

What is there left. I have no goals, no life worth living. No positive thing getting me up in the morning. Im always the one that has to be there for others but now, I can’t even be there for myself. I guess time can’t heal certain things and really its okay to give up. Who will care in the end, when there is no one left to care. The good news is, that makes this a much easier decision. 

Idk what I had hopes of getting out of posting this on here. Maybe someone going through the pain as well. Hearing one more “It’ll get better” makes me even more inclined to end it. It never does. People die, leave, abuse, neglect, cheat, lie, no matter how positive you are. Or what you’ve been through. It’s all for their own benefit in the end. Life isn’t worth living right now. In this world. Too much suffering everywhere. Maybe in the next life, society will be better. Or nonexistent. Or worse. Who knows. To those that want to stick it out, good luck. I wish you the best.

Things in my life have progressively gotten worse for over four years..I thought back in 2019 that things were finally going to get better.. but then 2020 reared its ugly head. 

I've looked up a method I found will be quick and easy to execute. 

I don't think much will improve between now and Dec 21, and I already have been recording video goodbye messages to my friends, my hateful dad, and to each of my children that I haven't seen in over four years. They're better off without me, but at least I figured I'd owed a long, video response to each of them. Might do one for the ex wife who has ghosted me since 2016, but I'm sure she'll be happy once I take my own life.

No one is really going to care once I am gone anyway, but before I do it, I'm going to make sure I have a nice meal.. I already have a nice black dress ready to wear and I'm going to make sure I am made up with all of my makeup, my hair... try to smell good to hopefully mask some of the smell so I won't be too stinky for whenever my dad, or police or whomever finds me. 

I plan on cleaning everything in my house.. and I mean everything.. I figured I should at least leave a clean house so my dad won't have much to worry about in regards to wanting to rent out or sell this house (as he's the owner of the house). 

Sure, some people might be sad for a few days.. but as time passes, I'll simply be forgotten and no one will really miss me when it comes to the whole big picture of life.

My counselor and the mental health clinic I've been going to for nearly two years .. I feel .. don't really care about me. it took FIVE WEEKS for my anxiety and anti depressant medication to arrive in the mail this time (as they are rightfully not doing in person pick-ups due to COVID), with this pattern happening over and over again for nearly six months now. It sucks having all of these problems with bipolar, PTSD and MS thrown into the mix of everything.. can't get health insurance because I can't work.. even though I still have been trying to find a decent paying work-from-home/remote job.. seems impossible. 

And before anyone says so, I have already spoken to suicide hotlines on probably no less than 25 times. They can't magically fix my life.. they can't magically bring my children back into my life.. they can't magically make my dad love me. No one can talk me out of this. 

But at least will prove everyone right.. my ex-wife, my dad, all of the bullies and internet trolls who have called me weak .. each and every single one of them will come up winners and won't ever have to worry about interacting with me ever again after Dec 21, 2020.

Whatever the case is, you tell me you don't want to deal with me and you just tell me I should leave, I live here &amp; you make me want to kill myself even more by telling the shit you tell me. Its almost like you encourage me to at some moments.

 ""Whatever go cut yourself I don't care""
 
You've outright told me go ""do whatever you want I don't care""

Before you say “but you are only 15, you have so much ahead of you” trust me, i cannot see a future at all. 
I have given life already so many chances and they have all shot me down. 
It’s the time to make the people happy who make me sad for their own benefit. 
I am deciding to write a note. 
I am almost about to overdose and go into the woods for a while. My mother works nightshifts for an important job, my father is / was abusive, both mentally and physically. He messed me up mentally forever. He is a narcassist. 
I have a good mother, she knows about my mental health and how bad it can be. She knows i’m suicidle. 
I have a therapist, she is nice and i have medication for my mental issues. 
But all i live for is for people to walk all over me, pick on me, physically hurt me. Fucking destroy me when they don’t even know it. 

They tell me to kill myself, infront of people, even a teacher once, she didn’t care the slightest. 
They don’t know that i’m hiding everything. For years. 
Every little insult, name, punch, adds on to it. It’s past breaking point. I’m already broken. 
I don’t want to call a hotline or 999 or some other thing. 
I do try to avoid hurting myself. 
I just want to make people happy. The ones who are better than me. They deserve it. 
I’m not comparing “me to them” although it might sound like it. To be fair, i probably am. But still, they have everything i could ever wish for. Friends, a kind, loving father, non-suicidle tendencies, no mental issues. 
I cannot do this anymore. I don’t want replies, i know that life doesn’t get better. Well, atleast for me anyways. I have nothing to lose. 
My mother will most likely be sad. 

Mother, i am sorry for everything. I know i can be an arse sometimes but i love you. I know you love me back. I will miss you. 

This post may well get deleted shortly. I apologise to the ones who i may have hurt. 

If there is someone who can genuinely convince me not to kill myself tonight, i will not. You have my word. Change my mind. I’m doing this for my mother.

Nothing new, nothing new at all, just the good ol’ Rob, the one and only Canucks lovin’, Yankee lovin’, Semi Nerf Warrior, Video Gamer, Chess Player popping in for another rant on here about how I want to kill myself because I have noooooobooooody to talk to. I kind of wanted to do that as an entertainment type thing because honestly at this point it’s a game, I wake up every day, I go to school where I’m miserable, I go home and do my thing, I cry myself to sleep, and repeat because I’m pretty much a loser at the age of fourteen, almost fifteen. I’ll admit, I’m young, but life fucking sucks man. It fucking sucks, especially if you’re a loser like me who has nothing to offer because not only am I socially awkward AND barely have anyone to talk to (PSA: it’s very lonely and crippling, especially feeing like you’re on the outside looking in), I’m fucking ugly so no girl wants me, now I get the whole “oh rob!!! Don’t rely on girls or people for happiness” or the “aw rob!!!! Don’t sweat it buddy!! You’re not ugly!!!! You’re beautiful!!!” but it gets tiring because EVERYONE says it and at this point I know it’s bullshit. Like honestly it’s not fair and I know life’s not fair and that I should man up but I just wish I could have more people to talk to because I only really have three people outside of my family that I talk to on a regular basis and two of those people online and one of them is in real life and honestly I’ll say I keep my family contact to a minimum I don’t really talk to family often, for the other two people daily, for my real friend every few days sometimes for a few minutes I guess about video games or whateva and it fucking sucks and gets lonely and I’m gonna admit right now, I believe in God and I love God, but honestly his plan is NOT a good plan for me because who am I? I’m literally a fucking fourteen year old loser who plays video games and chess and you know the rest I ain’t repeating it out of self pity and honestly I’d be long gone off this stupid rock shit-hole if my family owned guns because that seems to be the easiest way out. Now, I know, I’ve got Christmas to look forward to, but it’s still a long ways away and I’m only gonna be happy for a day, A DAY, I don’t want to be happy and at peace with a break for a day, I want it to be that way every day. Not only that, the world is getting shittier and shittier every moment and people are becoming suckier and suckier and everyone will leave you anyways so there’s no point. At the end of the day, I’m just a pathetic guy who’s always gonna be a sucker anyways so honestly I feel like I’m doing semi good because I accept that. I’m gullible, I’m useless, I’m pathetic, and I’m nothing but a bother for people honestly, I’m just that fly that won’t leave anyone alone. So yeah, the first step is acceptance really, the second step is living to well live until I’m 19 at least and can buy a gun or sooner if I know anyone with a gun.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's close to 4 am and I'm back home. I just walked to that bridge close to my flat. My husband is asleep and i just walked out and stared down into this big dark empty nothing. I thought about what would happen if i do it. Who would miss me and what I would miss out on if I just do it. I thought about it for quiet some time now and I don't really know how it all happend. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have a good life. A very loving and supporting husband, a cute cat, a great job and amazing friends, but somehow i just feel so empty. I'm always so happy and friendly, energetic and cheerfull. I help everyone around me and I'm always the first one to help others. I'n my freetime i volunteer in different projects, with kids or homeless people (not right now because of covid), i learn how to play the piano and i took singing lessons until the beginning of the year. I started to learn french as well (my 4. language).

Everything was just great and then it just stopped being great. At one point there was just nothing. I can't answer any messages anymore, i don't want to play piano I don't want to play any games, don't listen to music, nothing. My head feels like it's about to explode and i just need to end this pain. I really don't want to, but. 

I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't seem to know anything lately. It's the only answer i have for anything right now. Just: I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know why I'm sad, I don't know whats wrong, i don't know why i want to end it, I don't know what is happening it the world right now, I don't know how to cook my favorite dinner any more, I don't know why i don't want to clean the flat anymore, I don't know why I cant get out of bed, I don't know why I'm here, I don't know what i want to do with my life, I JUST DON'T KNOW....... 

&amp;#x200B;

And it just dosen't help that all the people admire me. They tell me how great my life is, they tell me that i got such a great husband and an amazing flat, they tell me that they would die to have a job like mine, or how they could never be that active in their free time, or how i can always be nice to anyone. I just want to scream in their faces sometimes, want to hit them hard and tell them I'M NOT OKAY! But what ould they think of me if i do? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am autistic. Women who are on the spectrum have a very high chance of getting depressed at one point, but they dont always get the help their want. A lot of depressed and suicidal people don't get the help they really deeply need. Why should i be any better than anyone else?

&amp;#x200B;

A car came by that bridge. A taxi and the man inside stopped and asked me if I'm okay. I told him I am, but he insisted to take me home. I don't know if i would stil be standing there, since i don't have the balls to actually do it i think. But to be honest I don't know. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was feeling it for the last few weeks. It was getting worse, to the point where i could not hide it anymore and my coworkers came up to me, to ask me whats going on. I started crying and left to the bathroom. It got to a point where i told my parents everything. I told them, that i just dont know why i feel that way. My dad said i will be okay. He knows me long enought, so he must know right? My mother said i should get help, but I don't want to. I don't want to be a faliur. I don't want to put my problems on someone elses shoulder and call it a day, especially, since i don't know what my problem is. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel very pressured, but nobody puts pressure on me. I feel bad every second i did nothing, because it is a wasted second, witch i could have used to make the world a better place. At the same time i don't want to do anything, because i feel like it would not have any use what so ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if i should make this post and i might delete it later, but at the moment it helped to just write down whats in my head. I'm sorry that i took your time. I know you could have done something better with it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always say to my friends, that they should remember, that they are loved and that i love them and they say they love me too, but what if noone cares? 

&amp;#x200B;

Why are we here? Why can't i be normal? WHy is my autism so hard. Why do i have to mask all day (not facemask, masking is a term for fake frindliness for autistic people)? 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sorry for the long post. I guess i got carried away.

It’s the same every day. I don’t have any free time because of my procrastination and the fact that my high school is one of the most demanding schools in the US. I’ve had mild depression for years, mainly starting when I got to middle school. Since then I’ve had really bad cases of social anxiety and in 8th grade I got so close to suicide multiple times. I feel like everyone secretly hates me even though I have no reason too. With quarantine I just stayed away from my family as much as possible and I spent so much time alone. I’m not religious at all and I feel like it’s a load of bullshit created to control people. So naturally, I realized in like 7th grade that everything I do has no purpose. With quarantine now causing me to feel like nothing’s real I see no reason not to commit suicide. My life isn’t very hard I live in a high middle class family with my dad being really nice but he’s rarely home and I almost never get to spend time with him. My mom on the other hand I have so many mental problems with. She has a few problems of her own and I had many unforgettable moments with her that cause my brain to see her as an enemy and someone I should fear. I always try to stay alone because of her and that I just don’t want to be with her. I’ve been suffering from a mild case of anorexia lately and I’m usually only eating lunch. I just see no reason or purpose to me staying alive and just being sad all the time. I stay in my room like 7/8 of the day and the only time I enjoy is with my sister or my friends in my neighborhood. Problem is that past 2 weeks I got sick and I haven’t been out of the house for a really long time causing everything to worsen.

My other friend I feel like I'm losing more and more everyday. He just isn't the same since July when he got a girlfriend. She's manipulative, and doesn't really benefit him at all. She just pulls me and him apart, and she even sent me a long ass paragraph (that I'm pretty sure was written by him) apologizing for being that way.

My family is really weird, my mom has always been in and out of my life and it really messes with my head because every time she ""comes back"" I always get my hopes up that she might actually try.

I have a step mom who is pretty much half and half, she can be really mean to me one minute and the nicest person in the world the second, really not much to say about that.

The first few months everything went good and it seemed like I made the right choice. I felt like I was being heard and was able to address lots of underlying symptoms that have lead to my codependency such as my mom's physical abuse when I was a child.

I had a relapse in march though when I made the mistake of telling her I was suicidal. She then had me involuntary hospitalized and our sessions were never the same again.

To cut a long story short it seemed after my hospital stay she was getting upset that I wasn't progressing at the speed she thought I should be. Our sessions instead of being a place to explore my emotions were her lecturing me for a hour.

I tried to make my discomfort heard but she would ignore it. Eventually I blew up on her at a previous session. Immediately after I knew I had just triggered myself as I knew once again due to my battling my emotions with this fucking awful disorder it would cause another person to give up on me. This time a fucking therapist.

My fears were proven correct when my next weeks session was suspended. When I called to inquire to see if I was terminated as a client I was told I would be seeing her and her supervisor in a session next week. I was also told not to contact her ever and wait till the session implying that she was uncomfortable with me.

So now I feel fucking worthless. Am I just a monster that is designed to fuck everything up? :( I did everything I was told to do. I was honest in every one of my sessions. But even a fucking therapist has treated me now like I'm beyond help.

Why can't I just fucking die without a threat of a psych ward :(.",Am I the problem? :(,1

I was 23 at the time now I'm 25. 

I commented something on a Facebook post, and this person wrote. 

""you are a I can't even say it, I was always told not to say anything if I didn't have anything nice to say but damn dude really""? 

Option A - Say something nice

Option B - Say nothing at all 

Option C - Say something mean (what they did) 


Not only did they choose to say something mean, but they choose not to even mention the insult the where referring to. (This would mentally ruin/fuck up ANYONE! not just me) 

My life has never been the same since I read this persons/strangers comment. 

Of the 1,440 minutes in a day, I spend almost all of them when I am awake dwelling/ruminating on this comment. 

What was that person going to say? 

I have a strong feeling they were referring to the word/term ""retard"" (or ""retarded"") 

So I spent hours googling that term, I am almost certain that this is the mystery word they were thinking of after writing (you are a) and before writing (I can't even say it) so I can finally let it fucking go (I can't let it fucking go). 

Whoever wrote that comment to me, I'd hope they die a a slow and painful death. 

If I do get to outlive them, I'd go piss and shit on their grave for making my life that much more unpleasant.

1302,"10 years ago my brother came out as trans to our family. We all sat down at the dinner table and my parents reacted terribly, my mother said the most vile things and my father, as always, acted as if he knew us better than ourselves. I'm also trans (I know, my family is cursed and I feel awful for them) and I hated my brother for coming out, I thought if I could keep it to myself so should he.

Nothing changed, we just pretended it never happened and continued with our lives. We went on to college and graduated, but after that I haven't worked or studied since. It's going to be 4 years of doing nothing soon, and the guilt kills me a little everyday, but it's too late to change now. Today as I was feeding wild birds who lives near our house, which is one of my last few moments of happiness, he flipped out on me when I started cutting an apple for them. Instead of arguing I just left, but then he called both of us back and had an intervention, asking us what's wrong, why we ""have no ambition"" and why we are so disconnected, complaining we never spend time as a family, that we need to find work soon (the last I agree). My brother mentioned depression, but my father says we don't have it, and even if we do half of the planet does, it's not excuse. What he doesn't says is how every time I attempted to build a personality or to say anything I was always immediately shut down, every since I was a kid everything I saw or want is wrong. If I answer his questions with certainty he doubts me, when I say ""I don't know"" he complains I have no certainty. When I began to let my hair grow at 17, one day when we went to the mall together he whispered to me everyone was looking at me. The other day he just looked at me out of nowhere and asked me if I gained weight. Now he asks me why I am scared of going outside, why I have no confidence, I wonder why?

He wants us to have this conversation again tomorrow, and that we should bring suggestions to fix this situation. I'm seriously considering committing suicide tonight to avoid this. If I come out as a trans too I'll give him a heart attack and my mother, whose mental health has been rapidly declining for the last few years, will go completely mad or die with disgust. And there's no point in coming out now that's too late to transition.

I know I did everything wrong. A stronger person would've started working to be independent, but I lost all will to live when I was denied a transition at 15, after their reaction to my brother coming out.

But if I want suicide I want it as peaceful and painless as possible but I feel like it's irresponsible of me to just do it:( Other than lacking courage, my family needs me literally, my mum and also I owe myself at least a moment of happiness. Let's not talk about what ppl would say about my family after death which I can't just overlook.

But I feel like I'm so done right now, I feel like unconsciously I'm starting unintentionally or intentionally doing reckless things to myself and not caring what happens to me and thinking it all the time, or watching extreme stuff(feels like I'm torturing myself) that I don't like that past me wouldn't recognize me at all, I'm the extreme opposite of my old self.

I have pure OCD which means intrusive thoughts all time that can't stop, any subjectively bad scenario that could happen in any given situation I'm in, happens in my head on overplay. (Everything, well almost). What I feel is my brain on overdrive, and it's like me watching a horror movie 24hr. It's sucking energy out of me.

I'm also gay,  which means only recently came out at 23yrs to only my family. They can't do anything about it so that's why they haven't. They always get subtly irritated when it comes up. It bothers me so much that my family acts this way.. I mean I wish I was born a girl all the time and be done with it.

Although my biggest secret yet is, I haven't been touched, held, hugged, cuddled or kissed by a guy and since I'm gay by anyone, ever in those 23 years of mine and I feel like shit honestly hehe, it's kind of killing me. Never a date. I've always seen myself as ugly and fat no matter what, before going out with a guy I wanted to be perfect and desired so I didnt let guys see me much when I thought myself ugky(other than those I got rejected by), and since I've had body hair(here and there), neither could I let them touch me even though I wanted so I kind of avoided it(I know ridiculous, can't help it tho). I get family hugs and all but those are family. Now all I do is for guys basically(from lifestyle to mentality) to get any kind of attention.  And I feel like I'm starting to lose it in the head a little lol, just from everything and everyone. I'm also by no means ugly is what I get told, I've also tried tinder and grindr recently, I got called cute most times or mistaken for sometimes using a fake ""Tumblr boy"" image(which I find hard to believe), but I'm just convinced I'm ugly:/

I think all this happens because I hate myself so so much and I can't get over it, I can't love myself.  Whenever I look at a picture of myself, I find myself cringing and wanting to change my face. Maybe it was because of an abusive father?getting rejected by straights which are most guys on earth and being partially sensitive about it? Or just wanting to be a girl?idk.

I know that many people have lives that can be viewed as way worse than mine. But I cannot seem to shake this feeling of wanting to die. My life is very fucked up. I am 20 years old, I started making very poor decisions at 17. Drugs, Alcohol, bad decisions and failures made from then on up to this point. The one thing that's really making me insane with anxiety and grim thoughts is that I feel I may not ever get my life together. I feel I am so far behind other peers my age. I've gone to post secondary school for something I am not passionate for any more, so 2 years and $30'000 wasted. I also don't drive because I stupidly got my learners license late, and have failed my driving test 4 times now. I was never bright in school, and even when I can honestly say I put my 100% into things with school, I failed. Even my driving tests, I put 100% effort into practicing and practicing, I have still failed. I have found something that I am passionate about pursuing (Firefighting), but I am worried about going back to school and not doing well, seeing as how when I know I've given my 100% into things before, it has never worked out for me. I barely graduated. 

I have dreams and aspirations, but I am starting to think that success and my dreams aren't in the cards for me. I don't want / need much in life. I just want to do something I'm proud of, help others, and be happy. I don't need much. Just that. 

I've written suicide notes before, Ive felt so fucking grim that suicide seems like a possible reality. I pray that I don't get to the point where I actually do it, but I get close. I don't want to push my suffering on to my loved ones. I know it will turn their lives up side down forever and that's not what I want either. I just want to be happy and believe that I can do and achieve what I want in life. I believe in stoicism for myself, the ""just do it and get over it"" mentality, which is what I've been raised with. But for some reason I just can't shake these negative thoughts. Maybe happiness and a decent life isn't in the cards for me, seeing as how my pattern of failure in life just continues. 

I feel terrible even complaining, because I know many people have it worse than me. I should not be complaining at all, there is so much worse suffering in this world. But for some reason the weakness inside me can't handle the depressing thoughts. I just feel so mentally un well and I don't know what to do about it. If you read up to this point, I thank you. I would not wish depression and anxiety on my worst enemy.

I also apologize if this is not the right place for a post like this, I am still new to reddit and this community. 

If any one has any advice at all, please comment.

1314,"I've been thinking constantly about contacting a therapist to get in contact with, but it is very expensive and with covid going on, I'm worried I won't be able to have a  genuine connection with them. Maybe I'm afraid of them telling me that I shouldn't have an excuse to feel this way. 

I just feel like something has died inside of me. I feel like something has died inside of me and I feel it rotting inside of my skull.

Anyways, I've been doing really well since January because I started exercising and meal prepping. My abuser/step-dad died back in March and it didn't really begin to bother me until a few months later. The last thing I remember telling him was that he would ""die alone because he's pushed away everyone in his life"" because no one ""fucking loves him anymore."" He kicked me out when I was 18 years old because he was having mental health problems of his own (we later found out after he passed that he had PTSD symptoms from Vietnam and that he had early onset dementia around the time he kicked me out). He was covertly sexually abusive in that he would ask me about my orgasms and keep cameras near my shower when I was around 13-18. I don't know why my mom stayed with him. I've never talked to a professional about any of this, I just end up talking to friends about small tidbits of my life and I feel overwhelming guilt for doing so because I know that the trauma I have experienced  (watching my biological father have a stroke/become brain dead next to me slumped over in the car at the age of 4, immense poverty because my mom has mental health issues (I believe) as well).

I said that to him about 3 years ago, but I hadn't seen him at all. I always rehashed in my head how I would visit him since I knew that he was in a nursing home. I just told myself that maybe he'd be in a good mood and that he'd apologize to me in some strange way. That day never came. That day never came and it really bothered me a lot.

Right now, I don't even know if I want to be with my boyfriend anymore. The weird part is, I've been looking up houses to buy (I won't buy one, though) and higher-end apartments to rent. I know I may have not wanted to be with him initially as I had made a plan to breakup after getting my bachelor's this spring, and I suppose that now it is coming closer than I thought, and therefore I may feel pressured to be happy in our relationship again. I look to him for affection and for sex, and we've discussed this before. I believe that it may be that I have simply fallen out of romantic love with him as we have been together since I was 13. That, or I have never been able to know what healthy romantic love *is*.

I don't know if the sudden urge to get a better apartment or break up is even the right answer or what prompted it. I feel that it may be because I'm falling into a depression again but I'm not quite sure. I've always suspected I may have CPTSD (definitely), borderline personality, or bipolar disorder. The only way to get myself out of these funks is to self-harm, intense exercise, or scream and cry to music. I have to get myself into a ""high"" again. For others, that may just be a sense of normalcy. I feel like if I am not experiencing a goal or something intensely emotional (be it happy or sad), that my life is not worth living. I just want to not begin to hit my head into a wall or punch myself in the face or damage my legs just to feel something. I just get so tired of feeling this pervasive emptiness. I feel frightened that I also don't have a car and have to share his in order to take a drive and listen to music fill my bones just to feel alive again.

Yet by some magical fucking coincidence, my parents had started getting really nostalgic watching TV the other night - we talked about all the shit we did on holiday, the inside jokes we made, all the more things I could've and did achieve 5 years ago. Now I hit the brakes. 

I don't understand why they invest so much in me and I hate it. With the way I was born the amount of time and resources I took just for speech therapy and learning the most basic of social cues I felt bad enough for anyway, when all that ""development"" hasn't given back to anyone like they think it has.  I don't have any set talent left, I'm not really motivated by my course of study anymore, and now all I have is a wall of stupid fucking trust issues with all the friend groups I have to hop between from physically scaring them off. And it was only after these past 2-3 years, I loved to write and bake and just be dumb with so many different people and I have no idea what the hell happened.

Why is it so selfish of me to take these stockpiling obligations off my back?? Is it not more so being unwilling brought into the world to unconditionally fulfill other people when I can't even do so myself??? 

Whatever excuse I pile up, the bottom line is that I'm a coward and a bastard, to not decide between ""living"" and dying. I did have a couple writing pieces to get out - maybe having a lament of myself on earth to remain is a better compromise first, could be reassuring.

Till then, I'm done questioning anything, any kind of authority. The way I've been overprotected is never gonna change, and it's easier not to think on it at all. For whatever few years I have left, I think I'll just resort to a vegetable mindset.

1332,"At first I hesitated to post it here but thought about it  and decided too...

I don't see a future in me, I've already accepted faiing school and planned to end my life at the end of this year (well if i did fail because of my inconsistent work that matches my mood ). It's not the first time I planned to end my life if when I failed a class as it seems like the only option of failure is suicide....

Currently I'm keeping it in because my family isn't much as such as yesterday I felt their words nailed into my heart because I couldn't enter a competition and how they had high hopes, I also had a family member that also believed that I'm a curse and should be abandoned at birth which makes me have a hard time trusting too... And that how my are very biased towards their side of the family which at this point I don't think I would want to consider I have a family if they judge me with he father mother side as I am myself.

My close friend are there for me but I dislike venting to them since some of them aren't really good consultants you can say (sorry if your reading this) such as a time a family member threatened me to cut myself and kill myself while pointing the sharp end of a scissors towards me (that memory is a bit blur and not that accurate because I was crying badly after being punched on the right side of my ear ) and they said how it's a joke like oh they don't mean it... Ah yeah threating someone with a scissors that is actually what I do use to harm myself irl to cut and possibly kill my self is a fucking joke... Wow such humour... Also most of them are very well known and kinda popular at school which make me feel puny compared to them and how one of them once told me ""you can only trust you parents, you can't trust others, I can't trust you "" legit stuck on to me.... They are good friends but there is a certain point

I do have Internet friends that I vent to but alot of times they are fake and the times I've lost friends because of these fake people (I've lost 5 fake friends and sometimes damage affects my relationship towards other people and their kinda false  opinions on me)... I know most of them aren't sincere at time and aren't helpful. Yes there are some who does help me in hard times but I dislike to rely on them since that I've lost friends becasue my issue are so big

I honestly have a lot of issues that I still hold in my heart and at times even though I don't want to feel consistently sad and gloomy and dull for a long time a part of me don't want it to completely go away, I for some reason do like to ""suffer"" you can say, as if its a punishment for me in life and well true I've started self harming because of treating it as a punishment

One thing in mind I fear is that the urge not to jump out from the 2nd floor window of my house because I do have things that does keep me here and is my kinda reason to be here (mostly my love for games) but looking at my failed attempts (2 to be exact, first one is to ""overdose"" on vitamin c pills but failed... It was stupid, second was to hang myself but the rope... Wasn't secure and well after I posted a picture to my Internet friends how I wanted to end my life at that time because for a reason I forgot I had most of them laughing at me which makes me feel like a clown)

I know a part of me feels like I have hope, I have a future, I have dreams but a part of me felt like there is no hope and so on. Its very conflicting to me. Of course this current issue is affecting my studies and if I have my family finding out I know they are going to make it worst by scolding me, insulting, maybe beating after all I was also threated that in a certain circumstances I will be beaten up still ill be sent to the hospital and I do admit after that incident it took me a month to be comfortable to live here at home especially with covid around its harder

I know I'm currently in good terms with my family but not for long and Im still scared from that day and the  feeling of how at home is not safe, I fear that to happen now since here it's kinda on a lock down because recently cases have been skyrocket so I fear that if a day like that happens or worst I for sure will end myself because being hurt by someone close is the worst feeling and it hurts the most

Maybe first step is to get myself motivated to study at times like this",I don't see any hope,1
1333," It used to be a feeling that I was really fighting hard against but I've embraced it. Because I don't want to harm others like my mother by killing myself I'm not going to right now or any time soon. I also find enough beauty in nature/mathematics that it sort of keeps me going. Current evens are sort of interesting enough that I want to see what happens here and there. But ultimately I just want to die.

I've pursued professional help for this for a long time and have finally realized the help available is just simply ineffectual. I'm 26 now. I don't for the most part like or trust other people, I don't fit in anywhere, I'll never be happy, I'll never be free from high levels of stress. I'll never have a relationship and I'll never truly want a relationship. I'll never learn to enjoy work, or paying bills, or dealing with the responsibility of living. The ""rewards"" of working hard and of earning money are in themselves just further punishments and stressors.

I look forward to dying and hope that a life situation will occur soon in which I can take my own life in a way which will not cause distress to others but until then I hope to die of some other cause prematurely. In the mean time I will keep living my life normally and try not to be a burden to others.

1354,"I'm putting in a lot of effort into trying to claw my way back into a functional state of being, after years of being absolutely functionally useless. It's difficult, and I don't know how I can do it. I am frequently confronted with the thought that, if I kill myself, I never have to confront the fear of growing old, of disease, of being poor and suffering every day from poverty. I never have to see my loved ones die, I never have to suffer under the weight of my own inadequacy ever again. I will never have to deal with the pains of life, and all it takes is to sell away the chance to ever experience anything good.

Logically, I know that there's no comparison. That you can't weigh something like that, from this limited mortal perspective, living your life one day at a time. It's impossible to weigh the course of your life, and any trends you can see are merely smoke. You have no idea what awaits you around the corner. It could be amazing.

But it doesn't matter some days. I already opened the door when I was young, and some days it speaks more loudly. Telling me that no matter how hard I work, I will never make up for my mistakes. For the things I've done. I'm relying on people to help me, but I don't even want to help myself.

I wish it was ok to tell people to be nice to me, please, and be patient, because I am stupid. And bad at everything. I wish it was ok to wish for the world to be kind, because I'm 25 but I feel like a child still. Still afraid of everything he doesn't know, still wishing there was a safe corner in his home and his heart that he could hide in. Still wishing he could be happy. I wish I could protect that boy. I can't. He - I - don't deserve to be here. But life doesn't care about what you deserve. It feels like it rewards the bad things more often than it does the good.

I still can feel that promise I made, somewhere in my soul, to try and live. To work as hard as I can, even if it felt like dying was so much easier. I've broken every promise I've ever made in my life (that's not true but it feels like it), but I hope maybe I'll hold onto this one. It's the last promise I'll ever break that's to be sure.

I wonder what it's like to be better. To be stronger than I was before. I don't know how long I can walk this road, but I made a promise to myself, a younger, more ready to die self, that I would stick it out, and I have to show him something for it. He's waiting.

I have a shit job, my family are borderline strangers and have nothing in common with me, I've only had one girlfriend and she cheated on me.

I've felt like this for a while and have tried killing myself but when that didn't work out I went to therapy and took medication but by the looks of it that hasn't helped.

I met a girl this year that helped me forget my problems but she ended up having me as a plan B in a way. She liked me and my friend but she liked him more so if it didn't work out with him she'd choose me, I found his out off one of our mutual friends. I got over her but now she doesn't want to even be friends it seems, and is still trying to drag me along so I'm kinda trying to cut ties with her now and I'd like to say I have no feelings for her now but I do.

i have ptsd, and i have had like a sudden huge worsening in my symptoms a few days ago. and now like 95% of the time i'm dissociated, and i noticed that if I have a passing thought about hurting myself in like any way even weird shit, I feel an urge to do it and I actually think about it &amp; have to consciously fight it so i don't actually end up doing it. sometimes i do actually do it if it's not that dangerous, but often the urges are to do with stuff that would probably kill me or at least send me to the hospital. same happens with suicide. I feel an urge to do it, not from emotion or anything just purely intellectually.

it's just like ""ooh suicide, we need to do it anyways, do it right now"". there's no barrier, fear, automatic annoying ""you'll hurt your family, exc.."" shit, it's just clear cut 100% ready to do it like it's nothing. its like im on autopilot in a way and only my will can stop it.

pers find that kinda cool in a way, bc I was planning on doing that anyways in the next few days, but what i'm scared about is that I might do it with litterally anything and/or hurt myself badly in ways that would really suck for me and potentially at any time wether i want to do it or not at that moment. and that would be real easy to do bc aside from the urges, i can't feel pain half as much, am extremely extremely impulsive &amp; self destructive, have gave in to some weird urges, plus am braindead bc of ptsd. i don't want to add shit to my stupid life, fail, end up having to go to the hospital, exc.. i want to get it done right.

Edit: Man... I've wanted to kms for about 8 years now. I've been seeing a therapist since I was 5, been shoved with medication since i was 5, and it's been rough. I've got a lot of trauma from different things, and I'm just tired. I'm just so tired. I started seeing a new therapist about a year ago, and she's been life changing. I've finally started to see improvement in myself and my mental health... But I always mess it up. Whenever I'm doing good, I tell myself that I don't deserve it. I tell myself that I like the pain, and I go back to not taking care of myself (not eating, drinking, doing chores, sleeping, ect) For a while, I was doing really great. And then school came. And i just fell into this dark depression. It's been so hard. I've been crying for help, begging for attention, hoping someone reaches out. I hate reaching out and asking for help myself because i feel annoying and like a burden then. If someone asks me if I'm okay, it shows they care and don't mind me venting. Lately, I've been literally ""joking"" to my friends That I'm going to kill myself soon. None of them care. Only one person, bless his heart, told me not to do it. I'm so sick of it. I go to the end of the earth to my friends... And they don't do the same. I know they love me, but the lack of appreciation hurts. My therapist told me that I can be overwhelming because technically i shouldn't need this nuturing from them, but it's natural that I want it bc my mom was never there for me as a kid. And that hit me so hard. I hate putting my problems on my friends, but I'm always there for them when they're going through insane crazy traumatizing things... I don't understand why they can't handle being there for me. I don't understand why they don't know how to help. I know everyones different. I'm trying so hard not to be mad.

I'm so tired of being a friend to the world when it isn't one to me back. 6 months ago I said screw it, and I started acting super mean to everyone. That just sucked even more. Why can't I win? What am I doing wrong? I started self harming recently too. It's the only thing that brings me joy. I'm trying to get clean, me and my therapist are working on it. (Clean 1 day :) ) but it's hard. I feel like I deserve the pain. I feel like no one wants me around. I wish I could just end it. But I know my friends need me and I hate that. It makes me so.... Angry. Furius, even. Why?

1391,"It is unlikely that you will ever be committed to a mental hospital. But as someone who has, here are some tips to get through your stay, and get discharged as soon as possible.

1: comply, comply, comply.
Do not cause trouble. Do not fool around. Follow the rules to the letter. The better you behave, the more favorable you are for being discharged or at the very least, getting the staff on your side.

2: participate in therapy 
Whether you like it or not, you were committed for a reason. So complying with therapy is the best way to not only convince the staff that you are getting better, but to actually get better. 

3: keep yourself busy
I’ll be honest. Hospitals are boring. There are large stretches of time with nothing to do and it’s easy to go crazy or panic. Have conversations. Ask the staff if there are books or other forms of entertainment

So what i am i doing here? Well good question.  
I´ve always been mainly introverted kind of person, keeping people at arms length even family members,playing videogames most of my free time, not caring about much.   
But that all changed when i got started my career in IT, going from full introvert to mildly extroverted person. But thats when all changed, i started thinking about the world, and what people thought of me , but mainly ,the state of all things.  


I saw how F\*ked our corrupted state is, riots,new goverment, riots again, tipping point, fasists get elected to goverment, fasists get kicked out and organize riots against current goverment.  
And all i saw was people who were like yeeeeeee overthrow the goverment (again),giant cases covered up, journalist and his fiance getting killed for his work on the connection between the goverment and mafia, now corona etc..  
I look at politics world wide(china riots,USA riots over clearly won elections , etc..), and on state of all things actually, and it bothers me .  
It bothers me, that people who clearly cannot recognize right from wrong, and doing all this in the world, the worker people.  


I have thoughts racing through my head, day and night, about those kinds of things, and where they are headed, its none stop. But what my brain decided is, all is fu\*\*ed, just end it.  
And then the floods of how the torture of the things happening around us could be gone, just by ending it. Even became emotinally numb towards others and myself, i do not feel a buzz or something when happy or excited,sad if sad, or whatever, i just feel...empty,my mood does not swing by any news. Death? Meh, New life? Meh , i just pretend like i feel happyness, but i throw that charade away a few seconds/minutes later  


I know i dont wanna go ,but i feel like i have to, and hope the next life(if there is such thing) the world will be in a better state and not such a hostile enviroment.  
So no harmful things done to my body, i want my life to be taken away from me, how? I dont care. Few times i drove to work, i noticed i was thinking about swerving my car into the trees at really high speeds (200km/h+, insta death, right?), then i was like meh, i dont want to ruin the car, my brother may use it.But more often, when i see a vehicle overtaking another vehicle in a risky way, i stare at the driver, but i dont try to avoid the crash,in the back of my mind, its like, finally? Is this the man who will take my life from me ?

Back I'm the day I ignored the subtle thoughts, thought they will fade away eventually, but damn, they didn't

I'll adquire a passport to go out of this place. My household ain't bad at all, but my father has been absent most of the time cuz he's working hard to bring bread to the table, which I respect, and my mom has this archaic mindset of how the world works and appereantly she knows it all, and none of them believe in mental health, although my father tried to commit suicide a couple of months ago (or a year, I dont know anymore, time is so fucking relative nowadays), and yet he didn't reached for professional help. When that happened, I was conflicted, cuz wtf he's my father yet I barely felt any sympathy. Months later it kicked in and I was like ""wow, literally one of my ""role figures"" (since he's my father) tried to end his life, a dude that showed no signs of struggles. I guess that could be a bit of peace of mind for when I do it.

Although I'll be dead, in the seconds prior to commit the act, and even now, all I think is about the suffering I'll cause to my family, my nephew, he'll never see me again without an explanation, but I isolated myself for that same reason, I barely interact with any of them cuz in my mind is always popping the thought ""don't worry, it'll be all over soon"", and recently it has gotten worse, I can't engage in any conversation without my mind thinking ""yeah, most certainly I should end this soon, I can't interact with people"", which was brought upon myself, by myself

And this was a tl;Dr, there's much more to it. Why I haven't looked for professional help? Well, with all this quarantine in effect it seems a bit convoluted, plus I don't have the motivation, nor a medical plan to cover the fees


If I told you I want for this thoughts to stop, I'll be lying, for real, I lack all the abilities I should have at this age, I don't see a bright future, I'm indebted, without noticing it I've burned most bridges, and I don't think there's a way out of this

I live in a rural area, a bit far from the city and I swear I don't know what to do anymore, everyday is getting worse and I don't know how much I can hold this facade to not worry my parents, every hour or so I'm trying to hold my tears, and yet I'm doing nothing

1402,"I'm an adult. These people are adults. I have studied psychology, and am familiar with warning signs of abuse, as well as signs of red flag behaviors. Now that that's out of the way: most of my friends are suicidal, and as far as I can tell, all of them are genuine threats to their own well being. Due to a recent move on my part, everyone is far away, so I cannot physically protect them. There's no way I'll be able to stay and talk with all of them for every time they could use an ear, and I can't check in on every person every single day - there is not enough time in a day to gently coax honesty out of the people I love, because I love many people. It's not just my friends, either. Many of my family members are suicidal. It's genuinely looking like almost everyone I know is going to kill themselves at some point. I am also severely mentally ill, and have struggled with crippling depression and anxiety my entire life, which was worsened after I experienced severe trauma in my early teens that led to a diagnosis of post traumatic stress disorder. 

I really want to be there for my friends, but I need to sleep at night, and I am not the best person they could talk to - yet I am the only one. I have panic attacks when discussing a number of difficult subjects, suicide as one of the big ones. I have already lost several people to that monster, and have never been able to move on. Due to personal failings, I cannot move past death - I cannot reason with it, cannot conceive of it. At night, I dream as though the dead are with me still, during the day, it feels as though they're still here. Sometimes it feels like I'm one foot in the fairy ring, and very few things keep me tethered to reality. 

I'm terrified of losing them, and not just because I love them, but also because I selfishly do not know what I'll do when they're gone. I have no emotional support network to help me catch myself, or to talk to. Other than my suicidal friends, I do not have any close friends my age to talk to, or family members I can rely on. My Mom is notoriously spiteful towards suicidal people, and exceedingly cruel. My question: what do I do.

Everyone is different. I've read about how to help people, how to talk to people. I've been on suicide watch, I've had to contact hospitals and law enforcement. I've done interventions, bringing family members and loved ones of theirs into discussions. Any readily available information is something I've probably looked at already, and I've also contacted members of helpful groups to get information.

This is the reality: I know I'm going to keep losing people. I can't be there for everyone all the time, and even if I could, there are still people who will do it anyway. I don't blame them, or hate them. I just wish they wouldn't. They are important, their ability to perceive the world around them and build memories is important. Even if they stopped talking to me for the rest of their lives, I would want them to live. Even if they hated me forever, I would want them to live.

What do I do? How do I move on with my life, how do I sleep at night, knowing that while I sleep, I could be abandoning someone in their time of need? How can I do anything other than try to talk to them? How do I prepare for the very real possibility that all of the people closest to me will die by their own hand, and keep myself from following them?",Most of my friends are suicidal,1

1405,"Long story short, my life has gotten remarkably worse over the last 24 months, and I think about ending my life more than ever. But the reasons behind the desire to end my life are tangible, physical problems, rather than mental ones.

My point being that talking about these issues doesn't stop them occurring in my day-to-day life, so how would therapy help?

I delete the posts cause I usually just use this as a place to vent.  I say my piece, let it sit for a bit, then delete it once I'm feeling better.  But today, I took it a step further than just thinking about ending it.  

I live right near an overpass on the freeway and since my state's dictator has decided to lock us back down again, I decided to take a little walk to the overpass.  

My plan was to just stand there and look at the traffic for a few minutes just to see if I really did feel like jumping off.  Well you'll be glad (or sad depending on your thoughts on my thoughts) to hear that I didn't even stick around that long.  

I saw huge of wave of traffic coming forward and I started to get scared and left.  This is the closest I've ever gotten to taking action since I held a knife up to my wrists this one time.

Sadly, the only real takeaway I got from this... whatever it was was that I didn't want to jump right now.  That and if I do kill myself, I might want to find a better way than causing a huge accident on the freeway that could lead to more death.

I don't know where to go from here.  I'll probably just get used to it again and think nothing of it.  I don't know if this means I don't really want to die or I just don't want to die that way.  Either way, I'm still kind of glad I did take that walk.

I even wrote my friend: ""kill me please"" becouse I dont want to continue anymore.
I am absolutely crazy sometimes and I've been to a therapist that called me fat and said that I should do something about it (thx for kicking me down you hag) and a psychologist that I said I was suicidal and all she said was: ""well your parents would be sad wouldn't they?"" Like I care anymore should have cared for me more as a kid instead of digging a hole for all of their children money wise might as well have DEBT written across our faces.

1436,"I feel trapped. Please give me input because i feel alone and like i can turn nowhere

TL;DR- i need a weekend to myself but my girlfriend is making me feel like its a huge deal. I feel like if i end things with her shes gonna die

((Mods on r/relationshipadvice kept removing this for different reasons (ex. Moral dilemma, suicide prevention hotlines etc.) i want to be CLEAR that the only thing im asking for is some feedback on my situation and maybe some advice. I hate feeling this stuck and i just want some help.))

I know that the relationship i (20m) have with my girlfriend (18f) is unhealthy and always was, but I don’t know if I actually want to leave her, because i do love and value her, but she brings so much stress onto me because she’s bipolar, suicidal and clinically depressed. See I realize how fortunate I am to have someone who loves me as much as she does, and she has put up with a lot of bullshit from me (drug abuse, emotionally outbursts, selfishness, walking out, being rude etc.) 

but this latest feeling has started from me needing to have a weekend to myself, because being alone is sometimes the only way i can collect my thoughts. I was burning out like 4 weeks ago and told her i needed a weekend and she was fine for a bit but then ended up blowing up my phone and stressing over me “leaving her” or not being there, even when i explain im staying and i love her. she needs me but i feel like she needs me too much and i need some space. 

Im worried about walking away and breaking up because im scared that im gonna regret it, especially if this pandemic doesn’t end and we stay on lockdown because i think that it’s important to hold the people we have close and it could very easily get lonely very fast in this isolated world and i already feel like im trapped in a 9-5 timeloop and she makes me feel cared for. 

But im also worried that if i leave im gonna sentence her to sink further into her depression because she has next to no support systems and the only other person thats really in her life besides me is her dad. Im worried if i break up with her shes gonna feel so alone that shes gonna actually follow through and kill herself and then her death would be on me wouldn’t it?

Shes already tried to die over 47 times before we started dating. And shes been on medication, shes been through many therapists and counselling but they aren’t taking patients in house anymore because of covid. Shes stubborn and is set on the fact that her life is meaningless and its like she needs me to be there for her but the “way im there” is never the right way. But im all shes got. I feel so fucking trapped.

I just need a weekend and it feels like its too much even asking her for that, because she frames it like im asking her to sacrifice something (i told her when i asked that i feared consequences from her such as not wanting to see me on the date we planned for me to stay over and she said she wants to see me. But then a couple hours later tells me not to come the weekend after im alone either and i feel like its punishment but she frames it like shes just helping me but Its not even what i asked for!!)

And she says i never change and one day ill learn to appreciate her but i keep telling her that ill be a better partner when i can just get some alone time. Literally two days.

This feels like abuse. Am i in the wrong

1445,"How can we believe in something that we have never seen. 
All my life I've heard things like god exists, there's some energy that regulates life and what not. I'll just share my part and feel free to disagree. 

I was born in a family where physical, mental abuse is normal and a routine thing. I became a victim too. I was f*cked up as a child. Scared all the time of what happens next. I remember I used to lock myself in the washroom and then cry for hours. I've a step brother and a step sister who abused me mentally and they still do. There's a lot of stuff I don't even want to talk about cause I'm already in tears, lol. 

A few years later (still a dumb f*ck), I got into a relationship. For me, relationship is all about loyalty. I gave it my all. I tried finding my peace outside home. But then again as luck/energy/god/whatever you may call it, had pain for me in store, I got dumped. I remember I couldn't get over that guy for 8 years. To me it felt like, I lost another home. Lol 


Today, as I'm typing this out (idk why), I feel like a f*cked up person who has no friends, is scared of love but is desperately seeking a home in a person. I tried ending my life once, but then as usual, god couldn't see me happy and he didn't let me die. He has chosen everyday pain for me and not the forever peace. 

Longing for a home for the past 10 years, all I've got is this never ending pain and misery.  Trust me when I say this, I've no one. I've no one in my life. People live for someone/something/a goal/a purpose, I've none. 😂

Even if I die today, I don't even know if anyone would perform the last rites or not. 

Now talking about god? How can we call someone so selfish, GOD? The one who gives every happiness to a few in exchange for endless pain to some? 

RULES OF LIFE 
1. Whatever happens, happens for the good. 

---&gt; Yeah. This world has made me a d*ck, someone who would prefer to die than live any damn day for a reason. Must be something good, no? Zero self confidence, arrogant, always crying etc. The good Reason - f*ck my soul up. 😂

2. Always try finding the good, in the bad. 

---&gt; Yeah. Why not. I've been mentally abused to an unimaginable extent and the good thing about this is that I've lost a sense of who I am, where I am and what for. The good. I've been dumped by someone I loved more than I love myself for the good. The good? I'm scared of love, of people and I can't vent my heart out. I can't love anymore. I can't love myself. 

3. Karma is a b*tch. 

---&gt; Yeah it is. In all senses, it is. I'll explain you the sense in which Karma is a b*tch. It does all good to a few and all bad, all the time to a few. 
It doesn't care about who you are, what you've have gone through, what you're going through. If it has to f*ck you up, it will no matter what. It is certainly a b*tch. 

4. Believe in yourself. 

---&gt; Yes, I do believe in the a*shole that I've become over the course of my life. I do believe that I don't deserve anything, that I'm someone who will suffer forever.

3 weeks ago I quit my job because I couldn't handle the stress and my stupid boss who is an asshole. I had panic attacks. When I came home my boyfriend helped me and asked me to go to his mother house if that would make me feel better, I said yes. It was a good week with him, he told me he loved me, how much he liked me, and so on. I felt like everything was gonna get better. Last friday he broke up with me, a 5 years relationship, with 4 cats. My whole world came down. He told me he didn't like me anymore and I couldn't understand, why, days before we were making love and being so romantic, everything was fine. And now, nothing. I was pissed, very pissed, I sent a shoe flying of anger, I wanted an answer, he only said he didn't know why. I was scared, my true love was leaving me, we had plans, we had our whole lives ahead. Even if everything was bad, with him, everything was better... He is my sun, my strength, he is everything to me. He was leaving the room and I panicked, I grabbed him from the arm, I didn't want him to leave, it hurt him, I released his arm. I hurt him, I grabbed his arm and hurt him. Fucking hurt him, out of fear. He cried, like I never seen before. He was angry, he wanted to leave, I didn't want him to leave. So I stopped him, without touching, I crossed my arms in front of the door so he wouldn't leave. I fucked up. He was devastated about me grabbing his arm that way. I couldn't do anything more than beg him for forgiveness. I leaved.  I traveled 3 hours to my parents home.  I cried more than I ever had in my life.  I begged him, for forgiveness, with all my soul, I have prayed, I did everything. But, he doesn't want to see me, to talk to me, he doesn't want to be with mr anymore. He told me I fucked all the possibilities with that fucking arm grab. Fucking shit. 
I've always wanted to kill my self... for a lot of reasons. I hsve failed a lot of things. But this. I can't forgive myself with this. I hurted the person I most love in my life. And he's never coming back.
Therapy never worked with me, and it's not going to work. It doesn't worth the try, he's not coming back. He is my sunshine, my strength, my everything. I can't live without him.

1470,"I've been depressed for years.

I've come to the realization that my death would ruin my parents' and sister's life. So, since then, I did every decision based on what could benefit them more, especially choosing a major that potentially gives me enough money to support them in the future.

At this point, I see no joy in anything. I feel such a robot, living just for convenience.

During my days, I'm constantly wasting time fantasizing about different scenarios and I get so caught up in them. It's affecting more and more my own memory. Sometimes I cannot remember stuff that I've just done. I even have trouble remembering the names of the people that I speak to regularly.

1474,"Tonight I realized something really key for me in my battle with mental health.

As much as I think about ending my life (daily), I have not once actually attempted it, and tonight I realized it’s because I am probably one of the biggest, softest empaths to ever exist. 

Being an empath is a double edged sword. A lot of the reason for my suicidal thoughts is because I have prioritized everyone else’s emotions/well being over my own for my entire life. I have never once put my own needs first and am now dealing with the repercussions of that. My life is not the one I envisioned for myself when I was younger.

However, the same quality that has arguably ruined my life is the one thing keeping me from ending it. 

Knowing that my mom would be absolutely devastated. Just the thought of putting her through that kind of pain literally makes me sick to my stomach. Any time I imagine what it would be like if I actually went through with it, I am overcome with guilt and sadness. 

This is probably a good thing, because if I didn’t care about how it would affect other people I would’ve forsure done it a long time ago. 

I’m not sure what the point of this post is, other than I guess hoping someone else can relate. It’s 4am where I live and I can’t sleep but writing this out has helped me sort through my thoughts a little bit. 

I hope we all find peace and hold onto a sliver of hope that someday shit will be different.",Being An Empath Is Keeping Me Alive,1
1475,"Seriously, I woke up before 2pm, I went outside, I ate food, I touched a vegetable for the first time in weeks, I wasn’t trying to stay up too late, I finally managed to schedule an appointment with a psychiatrist, something I’ve been putting off for weeks... everything you’re supposed to do, and everything I’ve been struggling to manage in addition to all the other issues.

But then, last night, I felt awful. I ended up throwing up in my own bed. I think it was food poisoning since my stomach felt better after emptying all its contents, but I felt weak, shaky, generally awful. I was able to pull off my bedsheets and toss them in my laundry hamper, but... I just felt so... discouraged. Disheartened. It really fucking sucked. I’d already had to go to the ER earlier this semester because I had thrown up for no apparent reason and couldn’t stand or anything, and while it wasn’t as severe this time, I still got very upset. Throwing up is not the norm for me, and in high school, I’d been pretty physically healthy all things considered.

I cried myself to sleep. When I woke up for a psychiatrist appointment, one which I had been really, really nervous about making, I noticed on the medical provider’s website (it was a telehealth appointment) that there wasn’t an appointment listed for me. This has happened before where it wouldn’t show up until the actual appointment time, so I waited a bit (though I was really nervous) before contacting anyone. The appointment time came, I waited a couple minutes, still nothing. So I called the appointment office to tell them I couldn’t see it, that I was supposed to have an appointment at this time, etc.

Apparently, this psychiatrist had called me at 7:50-ish to cancel. 

I just... I rescheduled, but... usually, the doctors if they have to reschedule will send a message through the website the provider uses, but there was nothing, not even an automatic notification that the appointment had been canceled. I know doctors run into issues all the time (with a patient, family, normal work reasons), but... the last time I dealt with behavioral health with this provider, it wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t great, and my last psychiatrist that I had long-term ended up retiring, and I had no idea until later when I was trying to schedule an appointment with her. 

I just... I want to cry. I know these are things beyond my control, but... I thought things were finally looking up a little bit. I know my rescheduled appointment will probably go okay, but... it’s at 8am tomorrow, and I just... I know I’m going to be exhausted going to it. I already feel weak, and... this just fucking sucks so bad. I hate this. I hate that when I try to do “the right things” to get better, it’s almost comedic how badly something will go wrong, or how there will be a string of bad occurrences. I wouldn’t be surprised if my rescheduled appointment got canceled, too. Hell, maybe I’ll just even think about not dying today and get fucking hospitalized for no reason other than my body apparently hates me.

I’m just trying to get some basic human functions back. I’m just trying to eat more than one meal a day and sleep a bit more regularly. I’m just trying to actually do what I’m supposed to and been trying to do. I’m just trying to have a not-terrible day, and then... and then everything around me says, “No.”",I was having a good day yesterday...,1
1476,"I made an attempt a few months ago. My housemate found me and I ended up in hospital and was treated.

1477,"Hello. I am 14 year old and I have a question. ""Is my family abusive?"" I wrote down 3 stories I remember down below... I am VERY privileged, but I feel like my family is abusive so I wanted to ask if I'm being just dramatic or if theyre actually abusive.

Incident 1: So basically my step mother sent me to the store 3 days ago THREE times (I had to walk) so I was a bit tired when i came home. When I woke up (yes, i fell asleep), I asked her for my keyboard so I could do my homework and she gets mad and says ""Did you put your coat away when I asked you to? Did you separate your clothes? No, right? You fell asleep. So I CANNOT give it to you"" Then she misgendered me and when I POLITELY asked her not to (She's knows I'm non-binary) she said ""this is my fucking house so I can call you whatever I want young LADY. If you don't like it leave."" So instead of misgendering her back or being disrespectful I walked away and told my aunt about it (i thought she was more understanding...  i was wrong), and she said ""You are a female biologically so she isnt wrong.."" and started going on about how I had a mental illness... After, I sent an email to my step mother (it was articles and stuff like that) because I wanted to educate her on why her actions were wrong because when I tried to have an actual conversation about it she smiled and misgendered me on purpose again so i just sent an email. She opened the email but showed my aunt (she sees my aunt as some sort of weapon to use when she doesn't get her way) and my aunt was like ""you can't push your beliefs on others"" ""she didnt consent to this"". And I was like ""??? HOW??? I'm just educating her"" then I walk away again because my aunt talks a lot of bullshit and constantly contradicts herself in an argument. Then, she calls my brother over and asks him if he agrees with her. He says no, so she called my step sister because she knows she'll agree with her no matter what because she's so afraid of her. Obviously my step sister says yes and I guess that satisfied her so she came over to my room and started ranting about how I'm mentally ill and how she wouldnt care if i was dead or got raped and sick shit like that. (She ALWAYS does this to see if i'll cry... I used to but I'm so used to it that I don't cry anymore. I just ignore it). After, I go back to doing my work and she starts saying nice shit like ""don't let anyone tell you who you are.. blah blah blah...i accept you... blah blah"" (I don't know why she does this. After every single argument she just becomes this kind person and says ""you know I love you, right?"" and it's so confusing). And then the next day she tells me about how weird I am and shit. Oh, and my aunt and step mom still misgender me btw! At least my siblings are decent human beings!

&amp;#x200B;

Incident 2: This happened like last year, but I remember it so clearly. So basically my aunt was trying to straighten my hair (I'm mixed so I have curly hair) and since it was still wet, the heat from the flat iron made it feel like my scalp was being burned, so I told her to stop several times. She didnt listen until I eventually started crying and yelled ""Stop touching me"". She saw this as disrespect and started dragging me by the hair across the room (while body shaming me... i'm not even that big... she just knew that i was insecure about my weight so she did that to hurt my feelings). Then she hit me with the flat iron all over my body until it broke, but I got burned because she almost hit my face so I raised my hand to cover it and well... it got burned... After, she tried to choke me with the cord of the flat iron until my little brother cried for her to stop (he was there watching the whole thing). After she sent me outside in the cold weather (Michigan is always cold lol) and made me sit there (with no jacket) until my step mom and sister came home. I was there for 30 min. After, I went to eat dinner and when she talked to me I spoke in a rude manner (who wouldnt after experiencing that?) and she dragged me by the shirt and hit me with a long block of wood. She then threw me on the counter in the kitchen and tried to choke me again. After, she stopped and went and told my step mom how I was ""begging for my life"" (which was a lie... i stayed silent...) and I don't remember anything after that on that specific day.  A week later she apologizes and says ""you shouldnt have made me act like that"" and bought this medicine for scars and made me put it on my hand. I was told to hide it from people because my step mom and aunt didnt want people to think that i was getting abused... Funny isnt it?

&amp;#x200B;

Incident 3: I actually wrote about this on Reddit back in August but i deleted it because people were saying to call CPS and were asking for my information and stuff so I was scared because i knew if CPS was called they wouldnt do anything  and my life would get worse. (my aunt used to work at a prison. she's actually taking a criminal justice class.(i think...maybe she graduated from it? we dont speak much so i dont know) and my step mom is a teacher but she used to be a social worker or something related to that so they wont believe me if i told them what happened). Anyways I use Twitter and Instagram a lot so after a while I started SPEAKING like how I would on those apps and so did my sister so I asked my sister (cringe warning) ""Why is she (my step mom) so pressed?"" because she had a tantrum because I used her Lysol spray (I share a room with my brother so it always smells like a barn.) We laughed but my step mom heard me say it so like TWO months after the fact I said it she brings it up to my aunt. My aunt then says ""that's how ghetto blacks talk"" (it's funny because we're mixed with MOSTLY black, so it was really weird hearing that) and I responded with ""everyone says that"" and then she told my sister and I one of her fake life stories. The next day I'm called to my step mom's room and my aunt tells me ""pack up your stuff youre moving into the RV. "" (which btw was infested with rodents. we live next to an abandoned house :/ ). She said that if i got raped while i was there then i would be sent to live with my grandfather and if i got murdered that would be even better. I ignored her and asked if i could put my notebooks and stuff into a plastic bag and she goes ""no, that's OUR plastic bag"" so I respond with ""the plastic bags are free at the store you got it from. why cant i use it?"" she doesnt respond and just pushes me outside... I ended up not taking anything. I didnt go into the RV because i was afraid I would get bitten by a squirrel or mouse so i stayed under the tree in our backyard. After a while I decided to go to the grocery store nearby to get water because my aunt said I couldnt use ""their"" water (she keeps denying that she ever said this lol). I went like 4 times, but i was actually originally planning to go to the police station by the store and tell them what happened, but i gave up on that plan because I knew that they wouldnt do anything because my family acts VERY differently with strangers so they would think I'm some bratty kid. Also they know some of the police officers there. I gave up and went home. Long story short my aunt threatened to send me to an orphanage or with my ""abusive woman-beater grandfather"" and when she asked me if i wanted to stay with them or leave I said i wanted to leave... I guess she wasnt expecting this response because usually when situations like this happened I would cry and beg to stay so I guess she was expecting that. Anyways, after she started saying how much she loved me and wanted me to do better (confusing)... My step mother keeps using this situation against me to this day but i dont really care... It's ridiculous how all of this happened because of a single WORD.

I have more situations like these, but I'm not gonna write them because some of them happened when I was younger and I forgot most of it and also because it's going to take me a while to type it out. So just know things like the things i wrote above happens every month..... if you read this far thanks. Also I apologize if there is any mistakes. I had to quickly type this. And you may be like ""what does this have to do with ""r/ suicidewatch""?....The things that I have gone through have made me attempt suicide several times (since i was 11).... I was actually planning to attempt yesterday, but if I did commit suicide I would give my aunt and step mom exactly what they want and that's not happening. i just came here to tell you my situation because I have no one... My siblings are so afraid of my aunt and step mom that they just ignore me when i try to speak about the stuff that happens. As a matter of fact my aunt started beating my brother today (idk what he did) and got angry when he turned the mic on so the teacher could hear whatever was going on.... That bastard (my aunt) made him get naked and told him to go outside (he didnt thank god)... I'm starting to think she's a pedophile because she constantly flashes her privates at everyone in the house or kisses our necks and squeezes our behinds...One time she made my step sis touch her private part and thought it was funny...It's like she's obsessed with seeing my siblings and I naked...",A Question????,1
1478,"Before we start, here's a little back round information. Without saying this, my post won't make any sense:

\- I was born, raised, and still live in Michigan, USA. Parents were divorced ever since I was 2, I'm currently 16, and currently in a whole lot of trouble, physically and mentally. 

\- My dad is a christian father with a new wife and 2 other kids besides me. 

\- My mom is a stay-at-home mom with 3 other kids besides me and is dating a dude who goes to work all day to support the family, but is always grumpy, because his job sucks. 

\- My mom is a weed addict and is allowing minors to do it in the house, pressuring me to do it. 

\- I'm a part of LGBT, and my dad doesn't support me in any way because of how it's wrong. He had problems with this one person I liked a few years prior

\- I'm dating a non binary person (the person my dad had problems with, but he doesn't know), and this past Halloween, we had some time together, and my mom thinks we had sex, but we didn't, they just left a few hickeys. We're dumb kids, I know.

Let's get into the shitshow

I'm a lazy person, always have been. I don't really listen or do what others ask of me, and that's already bad enough. But with the whole situation of COVID, it made things a whole hell of a lot worse. School started about 3 months ago, and I've done nothing but dick off and play video games with my friends, becoming extremely behind in my classes. I'm really unmotivated to do any schoolwork and I feel like a complete asshole about not wanting to do anything. I'll think about doing something and how much it'll suck, but I just have got to sit through it and just get it done. But the second I sit down to do it, i'll do everything in my power to not do it, or get distracted extremely easily. 

Me being behind in school has gotten my mom fed up with it, having ""anxiety attacks"" as she calls them and starts screaming at everyone who lives at the house. Everyone realized who she's mad at and starts yelling at me too, basically disowning me and threatening to throw me out at age 16. I'd usually call my dad and ask him to come pick me up so we can talk about it and stay at his house for a few days. But today was different. My mom went off on her normal spew of garbage, guilt tripping me again, but I decided ""no, i'm gonna stand up for myself for once,"" but oh boy, did I break hell loose. I asked If I can go back on my medications and told her how it could help me in my lack of motivation, ADHD, depression, etc. She called up my dad and started yelling at him about me being a failure in life and needing pills to survive in the real world. She then started telling a lot of things he doesn't know about like the hickeys, be dating the same person he had issues with, and possibly having sexual intercourse, aka telling him we did. There is no way I can talk this one out with him. His house used to be a safe place, but now it's just as bad as my mom's. He's on his way as I'm typing this. 

I have never considered committing suicide harder than I have right now. I've been having suicidal thoughts for about a year, and always was afraid of death. But now, I really don't know. I genuinely don't know what to do. I'm just this terrible person that my family hates, so i'd assume it'd be better If I left, but I can't go anywhere because of me being underage to leave and not come back, at least legally. So me just killing myself seems like a better alternative. Does anyone have any advice to stay strong during times like these?","another post, new story",1

I got fucked up today and called her. I've been beating myself up really bad when I've been using. I wanted to reach out for help.

""No, a few weeks ago. Maybe 2 months?""

1539,"Not sure what to do, but suicidal ideation is upon me once again. I’ve been through antidepressants, not currently on them. The person who prescribed me them would give me short brief therapy sessions, although the appointments weren’t as regular and it wasn’t labeled as such (it was really just a refill check in).

I grew up popular, but under the hood I’ve felt rejected my whole life. When I was a kid, my parents relationship and divorce was extremely messy, my dad had a temper and constantly escalated loud fights in the house with my mom, always threatening to leave her and break the family apart until she had enough and did it herself. Because of his anger (we’re on good terms), I confided in my mom since I was extremely young. I’d tell her at the age of 6 that if anything happens to her I’d find a way to kill myself. My dad picked up on this, and since the age of 6 he’s guilted me, directly claiming to me that I don’t love him, which may be where I’ve adopted some of my harmful patterns from. I struggled to leave for school each day, as my thoughts were consumed by what may be happening to my mom. She was the only rock that made me feel comfortable. It was unbearable separation anxiety.

I was lucky to be put into a friend group who was popular throughout school. From that, I had the privilege of attracting the attention of several amazing women, and even in these juvenile relationships I emphasized loyalty and commitment, something that always came back to bite me. I always ended up rejected, even if it was after initial acceptance. I managed to carry a few relationships to a decent length, but always it became the case that I was a burden, placing my well-being in another persons’ hands. I entered college feeling like I wouldn’t ever find someone to love me (cliche for that age, I know). I spent some really lonely years with myself, distanced myself from so many of the people who, in some cases, revered me in younger years (for no reason other than I offered up my empty house for parties during those late high school and early college years). They knew something had changed about me, and what changed was that I no longer believed that offering a empty duplex I was left alone in due to divorced parents + my mom seeing someone new would lead to me being loved. 

I finally met someone I fell in love with. It was at the perfect time, and we met online (but in the same city of course) because I had closed myself off socially by this point. We’ve off and on been together for years, occasionally having to break apart because I am the way I am. She’s my best friend, one of the only people I can confide in, and she’s felt trapped by my uncontrollable tendency to place my well-being in someone else’s hands. When she’s gone, I don’t eat, I don’t sleep. The last time this happened, I barely held onto my job. And now it’s happening again, and it’s worse because she’s tired of the pattern. She’s sick of feeling trapped. It’s so difficult because we’ve been so in love and best friends to every degree, and it’s going to waste because I’m a suicidal maniac when she’s away. We had talked about working towards having a healthy enough relationship where we could have a family. When we met, she had basically no relationship experience, and she never wondered about what else was out there. It made me feel so special and we did everything together. Now, she doesn’t even know if she actually thinks of me as her best friend, or just someone she’s carrying through life. It’s pathetic what I’ve become, but I can’t see any way to go back. When I think about it, I’ve been this way since I was 5. Add it to my lifelong list of rejection, I don’t know how much longer I can take feeling unlovable. I’ve never left anyone, people only leave me. I have a life worth of examples to show. My separation anxiety with my mom never really went away, it’s just that when I met this girl (my best friend) she made me feel like when my mom goes, it would be the hardest thing in the world, but that we’d get me through it together. And now that she’s gone once again, my same 6-year-old kid with separation anxiety thoughts are back again. It’s exhausting, I’ve never once believed I can live without them",Spiraling again,1

im sick of doing my rituals and my intrusive thoughts suck

im so sick of shitting after i eat

im soooooooooo fucking sick of migraines

Im so sick of side effects from my meds

Im so sick of sitting in a dark room all day hoping i don't get a migraine.

I take so many meds to deal with everything, Even pay $1000 for botox for migraines that doest help

life is just a waste of money. I have a great family and girlfriend but i cant stop being depressed

I think about killing my self every second of every day, im just to scared to do it.

Im a truck driver, I can no longer maintain my job because of it all, i cant drive at night or daylight without migraines.

I feel i suffer so much that i don't have any empathy to care about other peoples problems, all i think is, really? u wanna kill yourself because of that, I WOULD KILL TO HAVE YOUR LIFE INSTEAD OF MINE (my friends, not people who post here). I know everyone suffers in there own way and its valid and stuff, im just fed up with my own issues.

 Omg!! There’s one good thing and that is I’m going to be on antidepressants soon it’s supposed to be for my ADHD since it’s a umm idk what they call it but it’s supposed to be for depression basically but its known to also help people with really bad ADHD as well, but I hope it’ll help me feel happier too

I caught myself saying it’s okay to cry while listening to a sad song in the shower today, almost seems like my like is so sad it’s funny. I mean happy song. The song was the only thing that made me happy today besides talking to friends and family/animals. 

I’m scared I’m getting anxiety, I don’t want to have it. My sister has it and that’s what made her start cutting. I just want to be happy. Everyone says middle school is the worst years of a person’s life. Doctors say that’s when kids realize they have mental illness. Because they start to think about their feelings more.

It’s selfish because I know that my life is pointless. Not in the grande scheme of things, because every life means something.

“When I’m a dead boy
Burn my body
Pour a couple of my ashes into concrete. 
Build a bench ten feet long, twelve inches tall.
Leave it somewhere, central Phoenix
Where no security guards will dare try to protect it.
Layer of wax on the corner near a QuikTrip.
With smooth ground so the step kids can do their kickflips. 

An ugly wave in a sea of ugly flatness. 
A beautiful wave in a sea of pretty flatness.
A mania wave in a sea of simple sadness.

Until they tear me down. 

When I’m a dead boy.

Here is where I’m gonna skip ahead a little bit, my friends and I were talking to eachother and I said that I accidentally got cut and was now bleeding, the bully decided to butt in out of nowhere and said “good, jump off of a bridge next” I messaged him back saying “wtf dude, you know I’m suicidal” and he replied with “if you’re really going to use suicide as a guilt trip then why don’t you just do it f*ggot?” I decided to just stay silent as to attempt avoiding conflict and he said “oh he’s staying silent, maybe he finally blew his brains out... good” that same night I cut myself so bad I had to get 5 stitches in my arm.

1616,"Hi there, firstly I just want to thank you for reading this and acknowledging my feelings, thoughts and behaviours. Just thinking about someone reading this all and understanding it, makes me feel a little but more confident  that I'll get out of this alive. 

I've tripped, stumbled and fallen down, over and over again. The constant bruising of failure numbs every part of my body, and my mind fills with static. I don't know how to change, I don't know why I should change. I don't know if I deserve to change for the better. 

""*Why do I deserve to change?*"" 

I've asked myself this hundreds of times in the middle of the night, and I can't find an answer. I don't believe I deserve to change for the better. I believe I don't deserve better.  Plus, the fact that I'm not in poverty, I have a home in a lovely neighbourhood and nice family. I have this opportunity in my hands, and I can't recognize it nor do I do anything with it. There are people out there who deserve the life I live, and I just throw that life away. Do I not deserve to die? Do I not deserve to be forgotten?

""*Why do I deserve to live?*"" 

I truly do not know. I'm rotting away in my basement, disregarding university studies and sulking away in sadness. I am an infinitesimally small cog in the machine of the universe, what difference am I going to make in this world. Anyone can do what I do.  Everything will be the same when I go. I will be forgotten eventually, and I'm okay with that. I deserve it. 

I just want to leave it all, I've thought hard about the consequences of leaving and even after imagining the painstaking heartache my loved ones will feel, I still want to leave. Am I not heartless? 

I don't know what makes me happy anymore. Anything that makes me smile fades away instantly and the thoughts of impending failure and dissapointment seep back in. 

On top of this I'm breaking my beloved family apart. I went to my parents for help about suicidal thoughts, they tell me a lot of people go through this and get out fine. They tell me to set priorities, organise my goals and talk to them more. I thought I was okay, I thought I was cured. But then I was told that I wasn't going through anything serious and that I'm just bitching. I snapped. Further tearing my family up, I left to go for a walk after snapping, never responding to any texts from my family for three hours. 

Maybe I am just bitching and being a wuss. Maybe I'm too soft for this world and I'll never make it. The world can be dark and cruel, if I can't handle myself, how can I live in this world?

My parents are just people trying to live their lives, it wasn't my place to bring them down with me when I discussed my troubles with suicide. I still hate the day I told them. I think I broke them a little inside. What kind of child breaks the heart of their beloved parents ?

I find myself weeping alone on top of a snow covered hill at 2 AM. It's not the first time I did this. Nor will it be the last. The tears freezing on my jacket as they fall off my face. I stare into the city, full of lights. I can't stop thinking about how much I don't deserve my life and how I can't find an answer to why I deserve to live. Looking at the city I realize that my life is stubbornly rigid. I get an education, I get a job, I work until I'm old and let old age take me away from this world. I don't deserve even a mundane life. 

I'm stupid enough to convince myself that I don't deserve anything. I believe someone who can be taken down so easily doesn't deserve to be here in this world. I'm weak, brain dead and useless. I deserve to die. 

TL; DR : I feel numb, I'm useless. I don't know why I deserve to live and I can't find an answer. I'm wasting my days away and I'm okay with that. I'm breaking my family with my troubles with suicide and I cry alone at night on a hill, in the cold. 

I'm just looking for a way to escape these thoughts and emotions, I want to be happy again.

Because I can articulate myself well, but I wasnt even able to finish middle school. I look and sound just ""normal"" enough to get held to expectations i can never meet, get treated like shit, and be called a liar. Ive been depressed since early childhood. Im angry that I was born and ive been saying that since age 5 or 6. They said id grow out of it or that things would get better, but things got objectively worse each year. No psych meds work on me how theyre supposed to because of my weird genetics, everything reacts poorly, causes severe side effects. ""Exercise more"" to help depression? if I try I faint. Walking is hard some of the time. If I had even one friend or acquaintance im sure it would help, but I cant understand or connect with people and I get everything wrong.

1641,"This is going to be a long one, so I apologize. I just felt like I needed to share my thoughts. 

I have felt barely anything for the past 5 years. I'm in 12th grade now and I still can feel barely anything. There are a few moments of happiness here and there but they only last, at most, three days. I've tried changing my habits, changing my diet, doing exercise, etc. I tried getting involved in community projects to see if I could be part of something with grander meaning. Hey, I could get involved in this politician's campaign! Or, I could help in the vegan movement!  I could help in my local animal shelter! Nothing works. I thought it was a puberty thing. Maybe something I could outgrow? I'm sure it will get better in high school! I'm sure I will outgrow it in 11th grade! Nothing works. 

I had this event that has been playing in my mind for years. When I was in middle school, I harassed a lot of girls with death threats, sexually suggestive comments, etc. I had a friend who liked this short girl (let's call her Alice). So, I betrayed my friend and told Alice that he was in love with her thereby ruining their friendship. She got so angry with me that her mother seemed to call the school to complain about me. So, now I have a group of 5 to 7 girls who were going to testify against me. I realized what was going to happen so I got angry and choke held a random classmate from behind until he almost ran out of breath. The director decided to get me mental treatment although they suggested calling the police (the reason they didn't expel me is that I had good grades. I was the only student to get an excellence award (99-100 average grade) in 8th grade). I was in a mental hospital for 2 weeks. 

My mom decided to transfer me to another school.  The problem was that Alice's new boyfriend was in this other school and I started to harass him too (both verbally and sexually). In about a month, I was already hated in the entire school and so I decided to leave before things got worse. Since then in my third school, I have regretted my actions and have been a neutral force. The worst I've done is threaten to stab a girl in the eye with a pencil.  

Now, every single time I'm not distracted, I think about what I did and fall into a state of deep regret. I tried getting help from a psychologist but that didn't work. I tried a psychiatrist and he told me that I just wasn't sleeping enough and that I had to get off my phone. This didn't work either. 

I can't feel anything. People speak to me and I just respond in monotone. I see movies and they just don't affect me as much as in the past. I am constantly reminded by my family that I have ""changed"". That I wasn't the same person I was before. AND I KNOW THAT. I feel like I'm already dead and I'm leaving my life through a TV screen. As if I wasn't any part of it. 

At this point, I just don't know what to do. Hope that things change in college? They haven't changed in 5 YEARS. I just want to die. I've told my parents, the few friends that I have, the professionals around me. Everybody tells me that they don't know what to do or that I should grow out of it.

I’ve been working on rearranging my room &amp; getting a new piece of furniture in. Today I didn’t have much to do, I’d gotten everything I wanted done for the time being. So, I watched YouTube almost all day. I ate with my family, spent time with them like I usually do. Rather than tell myself it’s okay to have a lazy day &amp; that I’ve gotten quite a bit done recently, I fixate on what I did wrong. I spent way too much time on my phone, I was unproductive, I always seem to find something wrong with me even when I’m trying so hard to be positive. The littlest things will send me into a dark spiral I haven’t figured out how to get out of.

1654,"Well, I never expected to be in a psych ward twice, let alone once in my life. But then who would have thought I would have debilitating depression and anxiety? 

Long story short, I got admitted 11/11, exactly 2 months from 9/11. I had a panic attack before an exam and took 3 mg klonopin at once instead of 1 mg twice daily. I was off balance (still am actually) and sounded drunk. I went to the ER where they cleared me. 

Except that maybe this would have been an attempt. It was to help my anxiety, sure, but I wanted to experiment what the overdose effects would be. I wanted to talk 4 mg but only did 3 because I would scared. 

I feel like this will be my life in an unending cycle until I die. First it was just fleeting thoughts. Then anxiety, then bad depression with suicide thought, then self harming and actually carrying out an action. I just know it will get worse until I kill myself and this won’t be the last time at the psych ward",3 trips to hospital in 2 months,1

I've been acting like a bitch all day and just planning it all out in my head, so tonite I will get snacks, make a great movie night, just one nice night I have to remember before doing it.

1658,"shit is just too fucking difficult at the moment. 
final high school exams stressing me out, probably won't get good enough scores to get into university and just will be known as a disappointment to my strict family. 
my relationship with my boyfriend is going to shit because of my mental health and he isn't talking to me to spare his sporadic mental health and now i feel like shit because i have just used him. 
my psychologist quit her job (don't fucking blame her, she has to deal with me) and i could rarely get appointments with her this year because she is in high demand, i feel not very important to anyone. everyone around me just seems to despise me because i feel like my depression has turned me into a monster. it just seems like there is no more getting back up. i have no support left. 3 different friends last night called me and said they wanted to self harm and i didn't have the heart to tell them i couldn't help them, because all i get told at the moment is ""sorry i can't help you"". i just feel like i'm just a vessel for everyone to use. i want a quick way out. i can't cut because if i do i'll be sent as an inpatient straight away, i couldn't think of anything that would make me feel more insane than i already feel right now. jumping in front of a car is not a good idea, that probably won’t kill me, there is no high places to jump from, i have nothing else, my medicine doesn’t help and i can’t overdose on it because the dose isn’t strong enough. if guns were legal where i lived it would be so much more easier but no. nothing. there is nothing easy. i hate it. nothing is easy. i get it, it’s fucking life and it’s unfair but why am i the monster who gets trampled on in order for everyone to excel beyond me. i’ve fucking had enough. i have no one. and i am so fucking mad that there is no good enough effective way out that will properly kill me.","i don’t care that i’m a coward, i want to give up.",1
1660,"&amp;#x200B;

I'm holding back on them words to say. 

But fuck it, I'ma give them life anyways.

I believe in living ahead in arrays 

Of lit roads that pave ways 

For the truth to be told and sold.

That’s meant to stay, so there is some fucking proof:

That I’m not your usual dude, I’m that odd cue

From a tv casted crew you see racking views.

Leaving you confused, searching for them endless clues.

About the real me of who I really am.

The weird person who nobody truly understands.

This wordless man who’s got his own mic stand.

Amongst the sheep crowd and his foolish band.

I digress, I'm not a robot  made from a tin can.

I’m just an ordinary man with a complicated plan.

Yeah, I’ve got major anxieties.

Depression’s keeping me from being me.

Playing chess on me, tricks on me, check-mated on top of me

I landed in the wrong zones, call it monopoly.

It’s a hypocrisy, I know, and I say it’s blasphemy. 

As if I’m locked up internally for an eternity.

And honestly, I’ve made this into a daily routine.

Mixing up realities with fantasies or was it fantasies into realities?

Which leaves me to believe what I think or see.

And I pray everyday for its final release.

I talk myself out of it from these weak knees,

That is getting pretty heavy for carrying empty grieves I held back my past for and I don't want nobody to perceive.

Because I want them to keep their purity and their wholesome beliefs. 

Mine is black and It was eating me alive. 

And leaving me some kind of distorted disguise.

A mask to wear to fly by, drive by, and wave sorry goodbyes.

That I had to put up to fit in and socialize.

As if I'm a wolf in sheep’s wool, keeping my teeth behind. 

Layer myself in some bullshit lie to tell you I’m fine all the fucking time.

Keeping them demons crossing the line,

Where I don’t want you to be in when you explore my mind.

I wonder why you want to be a part of my life, 

listen to my strife, 

world’s collide, 

word’s slide, 

tongue tied, 

Being too kind that I might die from their glowing eyes. 

That I find sublime, that I failed to realize.

The shining light you enveloped me with so much might.

I don’t know if my heart’s acting right.

My body’s feeling hot and things are getting tight.

Adrenaline rush, feeling’s running a bit high.

To the point I’m getting blinded

To who you truly are.

Didn’t think I had to look so far for a shooting star

That I dreamed of watching in lonely parks. 

Whenever I spoke of these lost bars,

I’m glad I believed in them from the very start.

Seems harsh, I know, but we all know it’s hard.

Increase the lightsource, push out the dark.

Stand the fucking ground, raise them alarms.

Cuz you’re coming through with a stronger heart.

Believe me, I know what that feels like to be split apart.

Alone in your car, crying out loud for a new life card.

That you wish you can discard into your backyard,

Hide it so no one knows the old you, the one you truly are. 

Searching for safe places to let down your guard.

Find and pick the ones you want from like a shopping cart. 

Screaming in pain from those tears, breaks,  and scars.

Write out postcards to yourself just so you can die hard.

Bury yourself into words, then the papers get jarred and gnarred: 

What lessons don’t I get?

I gotta press reset 

Deplug and forget the rest, 

Upload and download the mess, 

Thumbs down for feeling worthless,

And be processed to be the best, 

And then come out feeling blessed, 

and break every test life’s giving you. 

Your past are shadows, they go through you 

And it’s up to you to do what you wanna do.

You can be up in the sun or sing them catchy blues,

Mindlessly scroll, look up old tunes, repeat the drama news,  

Watch as life goes by like a watcher would view. 

Acting like a dumb fool who got played by a complex tool.

Acting like nothing happened, you walk out all cool.

Feeling like it’s back in high school.

Rumours spread that my love is overdue.

I’m the stupid boo who can’t produce

A simple truth we abide on a universal rule to break the roof.

You’re like a canvas filled with beautiful hues,

Of colors waiting to be painted aloomed. 

And then exalted for its flowering bloom. 

The adorable smile leaves me feeling brewed.

The laughs always get me to smirk a few.

The stride you leave behind is always new.

The pain you carry, has me hurting too. 

And how I imagined I can be there for you.

Hold you down tight to tell you it’s okay.

Cast off the magic that’s making you feel this way.

Shield you from the spears of hate, can you even relate?

I’m troubled that you’re scared, so you hesitate. 

Are the gates to goodness too bright for your taste? 

Am I too late to save those from the abyss lake? 

Can you do the same when I’m down a blade?

Can you be the other one who’ll share this fate?

We can share the blames, work on the shames,

And all the insecurities you threw under your name.

I can be a conditioner to fan your flames.

Whenever you feel the world’s got you feeling drained.

Tell you to not listen to those mind-screwing games.

Tell you you’re just a picture, perfect, crooked frame.

Uplift your spirits to remind you of the throne you always claimed.

The Kings aren't made and the queens are maimed. 

Society’s ripping people to become lamed and tamed.

Chained to contracts while we’re going around running unbrained. 

With no distinction of what’s real and what’s been falsely laid. 

But somewhere along the wire,

Our telephone poles got twisted and tired.

We were flipping tires going nowhere, just making fumes and geysers.

Deceived by the liars, scorched by invisible fire, led by fakes who got hired to stop what was supposed to transpire.

We could've  held  hands just to inspire, promote each other to aspire and reach higher.

Keep each other in the heavens we so desire. 

But the audacities that you marked on me, left me hurt.

Now the monstrosities are coming in to begin the burn 

We’re fed with fucked up philosophies of how to love in return.

What it got out of me was just a story left unturned.

And now it’s ended, the case has been adjourned.

I guess the calamity is what you really yearned for.

When did you stop being you, when did you start to unlearn?

As time goes by,

I can tell you had sleepless nights,

Endless cries,

Dark droopy eyes to encase yourself to hide those baggy lines.

Shit, you might’ve devoted yourself to addictive crimes.

To ease the suffering you’re trying to unwind.

Only then can we both wish to press the button, rewind. 

Back to a time when things were so well aligned.

We’re going to have to redefine our purpose.

But we’re not perfect and we will never be.

There’s gonna be cracks on the surface.

And that’s how it’s gotta be.

Clumsy tries.

Flimsy lines.

Things we can share with each other and press like.

Things we can disagree on the plus side and sigh.

When did we stop having faith in seeing human signs?

The difference is clear, where you and I come from.  
We’re like at two ends of some odd spectrum,   
The kind we can’t stop each other walking from.

Somehow reaching for touch, holding back from sheer lust.

Curious about each other, mysteries leaving us nuts.

The temptations like a fight, straight to the guts.

This deadly process I’m feeling, my chest is about to go bust.

Thinking this is just a short term rush, I dismiss it. 

But I’m finding myself biting the dust, it’s explicit.  

Decrypting it to see if it’s something my heart can trust.

Standing still and long but I’m blown by its windful gust.

It’s like an old time calling and I’m brittle from a brush.

Almost can’t breathe, it’s squeezing my shriveled lungs.  
Making my entire body go numb from the sight of you. 

I’m not invincible, your gaze will leave a bruise.

Petrified from the radiance, I can’t help but cruise.

It's a euphoric ride and it puts me in that luscious mood.

Wanting frequencies to be exchanged, yet silence brews. 

I’m becoming powerless and powerful, is this really true?

I think I caught something from you, some kind of bad flu.

I pushed you away, ignored, and still out of the blue.

There you are, persistent, maybe you're scared too.

The vibes I get linger and get us finding hidden clues.

Fog’s kicking in now, thinking what you’re up to.

My body’s in pieces and I want to see this through.

I’m sad as fuck, but this deadline’s kicked in due.

I try so hard to not let it get through.

The heavy armor I put up is coming loose.

My walls are up so why aren’t you making a run?  
I’m cautious, yet something hit the fucking drum.

Somewhere in the beat, I got hit by cupid’s gun.

Delirious, I’m catching myself from what’s been done.  

Baby, You’re dangerous with that parabellum.  
Your beauty shook me, nullified me, leaving me stunned.  
The smile you put on got two faces,  lessons learned.  
But there’s a whole side of you, easily hurt, so burnt, my stomach churns.

I’m fascinated by your story, each page, I want to turn.

Every side of you, I can’t help myself but I want to learn.  
You’re ice cold, that shit stings so I gotta be stern.  
Distance myself around you so I don't get readily burned. 

You baffle me with the amount of people you’ve slain.

Values and morals you uphold, you’re not to blame.

And you’re coming at me with brute force I can’t contain.

Neither can I explain cuz the blots are bloody-stained. 

Like a doctor, you’re operating on me to pick my brain.

Everything’s up for grabs, I know what’s to be played.

But every step you make, I dodge to stop a mistake.

I think I’ve laid countlessly because I’m so fucking lame.

To the point where we reach the end of the game.

I’m a double agent, so I crossed different lanes.  
Never laying down what I’ve been framed for.  
Caught in the act of something I really crave more.  
Maybe I’m crazy right down to my blackened core.  
But fuck it, I got this one life, i’ve been torned by wars,

Been alone like a lone wolf, People got me stoned, I must remain cold. 

To protect my weak spot, barely shown to others that my cover is blown.

Sit by myself, listening to how to re-live and be home with myself, self honed. 

Gonna have to focus on me  and my primary goal. 

I’m just a human being who’s heart is barely beating.  
Struggling to deal with these giddy feelings.   
Like every other beginner out on a journey, believing.  
And seeing things clearly with guilty innocence, bereaving.

Alone in this world like everybody trying to be in.",PUZZLEPIECE,1

I am now having health issues that are ongoing for two years and while my life is a mess because of it, I want to stay with my wife as long as I can.  

I recently learned that a spouse of a friend/coworker suicided and that she found her husband in their home.   The struggle of living in the home in the weeks after was too much and they sold and moved to a new home.  

Today I learned the method used was a firearm.  Thinking of my friend discovering her spouse of 40 plus years in this manner is hard for me to think about.   It makes me angry to think about.  That made me start to wonder if the place is an intentional part of a decision/plan or if it is likely not considered at all.    I don’t want to upset or offend anyone, that is not my goal.  

It may be wrong for me to voice this question.  I don’t judge others decisions about their life, but it is hard not to judge when a loved one (cannot think of the right words), makes a mess of another persons home in their quest to die.  I know we cannot ever really know in all situations, but is it the place a consideration?  Is it often a way to express anger knowing your spouse will find you and have to struggle through living in the same home?   Or, is it more likely that the person is not thinking it through to the spouse.   If one decides to die, do they care about what they leave behind?

Every time I start to open up my sin, relax and let my emotions get in I end up crying because the emotions are too overbearing and hurtful.

I wasn’t planned and although my family did try to provide for me they very well let me know that. I was ignored by all of my family and treated like a burden by everyone but my mother. But that doesn’t matter I’m just rambling. 

My mental illnesses they clash with each other it’s either that or they seem to make each other stronger. I lost a lot this year family my job whatever hope I had left is gone out the window and I’ve checked out mentally. I’ve been self harming since I was 13 and have had about 3 suicide attempts everybody says “it gets better!” But looking back on my first attempt a couple days shy of my 14th birthday it hasn’t. Im a burden to everybody and my depression and mood swings brings everybody down I avoid my family for this reason. I’ve tried to run away but I have nowhere to go I try to sleep all day so I don’t have to feel anything I self medicate but in the end nothing really helps I don’t want to live like this anymore and I don’t see a point in doing so it’s gotten to the point where I resent my family for bringing me on this earth to suffer and forcing me to stay because if I died they’d be “sad”

I just don’t want to live any more self harming doesn’t help my doctor cut my off of the Xanax cause he feels ill get addicted the only thing that was helping, nobody loves me I have nobody in my life besides my mom and my sister, I have no friends no significant other no acquaintances nothing. And even if I did it wouldn’t matter when I hang out with people I just bring down their mood cause I can’t find it in me to enjoy myself I sit quietly and stare off into space. I feel like I’m incapable of having fun or being happy it’s as if I don’t know how.

Because I’ve been depressed and had anxiety since probably the age of 6 I have no interests no hobbies I’m not outgoing I don’t step outside the box I’m literally just living to survive I had to drop out of high school because of all of my mental and physical health issues I tried going back 3 times but I never passed. I’ve been on a waiting list since 2014 for a therapist I still have never seen one in my life.

I just want all of this to be over I know my future isn’t bright and it’s just going to be more of this and more suffering I just want to take a bunch of pills and go. But I’m a coward and I’m afraid sometimes I even want to take enough just so I’d have to go to the hospital and people would take me more seriously. I’ve tried writing my suicide note a couple times I want to leave something for my mom sister niece and nephews but I can’t even seem to come up with anything I think I’ll just go without one my mom has the ones I wrote in the past anyways.

At this point it feels like my fate with suicide is inevitable it’s just a matter of when. I just needed somewhere to rant since I have nobody to talk to if you read all of this I’m sorry",I think I’m ready.,1

1691,"**I want to make it clear that this post isn't supposed to encourage others with suicidal tendencies. It may be too late for me..but I truly feel everyone else has a chance.** ***To be honest..I am confused.***

&amp;#x200B;

Hello, everyone just call me Angela for privacy reasons. I am thinking about suicide and I wonder if this year will be my last sometimes. The thought scares me..and I feel so close to my MAIN goal. However, I have so many battle scars I don't even believe I am human anymore. I have some questions...

***Do you ever feel like you are so strong? Does it ever feel like there are multiple layers of joy and sorrow? It can be hard huh?..***

*Those that deal with depression are some of the most genuine people I've come across. You* ***ARE*** *strong and beautiful..I'll never say ""Don't say otherwise"" though. I've learned from my experiences that, you, me, and* ***everyone*** *have breaking points and each of us* ***deserve*** *these breaking points. Whether it be a new journey or a old memory. I haven't had contact with a true friend in-person for the last 8 years in my abandoned/broken state. I've gotten used to it all..or so I thought. My goal to move and have a better life..so close but I feel the impact of the build up trauma over the years is finally hitting me at full force. I am strong..or at least I think I am. The only person I wish to stay beside is my mother.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*I don't really care if this post means much..or if it means anything at all. I think the reason I am on this sub is because there is that tiny spark within me that* ***knows*** *I am strong..but am I really? One of the biggest struggles is having morals and being a decent human being. The traits I carry with me is the reason I'm not dead or with the wrong crowd. The only issue is that these same traits are keeping me from completing a action that is horrible for some people. Now I have some more questions..*

&amp;#x200B;

***Should I be the good little girl for society and step away from pulling the plug and letting go? For the sake of others and my loved one? Maybe I should stop caring about those aspects and just give in anyway..it's MY life and choice. Isn't that thought process selfish though?*** 

&amp;#x200B;

*To be honest..I can't really answer the questions..not because I don't want to..it's because I CAN'T.*

*It has nothing to do with age, color, or race. It's all about knowing/not knowing, sadly, some people made their minds up and others decided to turn and walk away. Then you have people like me sitting and confused with which choice to make. I'm not scared of death..i'm just pondering if I SHOULD be the one to choose my date or not.* 

&amp;#x200B;

*Being suicidal and confused is a* ***struggle*** *and that's because I am fighting with myself and I don't know if I am winning or losing. This is why (personally) its harder for me to speak with others about my problems. I* ***don't*** *know if involving others will truly change my future decisions. I adore the love and kindness I'm given..honestly. I'm not only in a battle with the selfish and hateful people on the outside..I'm also, battling myself..but I thought I was the good guy..*

I've been reading up on charcoal burning in a tent as a good method of a more ""painless"" suicide. However, some people have stated that this method will make you throw up/wake you up because you are getting ill. Is that actually correct? Also, most people stated to take sleeping pills, but where can you even get over the counter pills that would do the job of making sure you don't wake up?
Additionally, how do you seal a tent enough to make this process actually work.

The second method I heard of is that you can hang yourself by your belt by slipping it through the door and closing it. 
How would this work exactly? Wouldn't it just cutt off some air circulation to the brain? Would this method actually kill you or leave you brain dead instead?
How long/painful would this method actually end up being vs the normal method if hanging?

1709,I’ve been trying to basically get through things my whole life. I’m fucking exhausted. Father was working constantly and never had time to really connect with me. I hated the sports he liked and he hated the sports I liked and there wasn’t much else. My mom is the only sunlight I still have. It was her and my sisters growing up. Maybe this made me more sensitive growing up but I’ve been through so much shit I have ruff end up. I was fat and depressed all through child hood and middle school until high school. I thinned out a little and became semi popular because I was easy going due to all the shit I used to get constantly. I met my gf there. The beginning started out bad but it got better through college. Until she cheated on me towards the end of my undergrad. I looked past it. The next summer she tried stripping. She said she wouldn’t do anything like that again. I stupidly believed her and wanted her around because it gave me some weird comfort still because I was working so hard in school and really had nothing or no one else. After college I tried to work with my dad. Well his alcoholism caught up with him and he got fired before I had the real chance to work with him. Pretty sure he just doesn’t want to be close to me. Flash forward to now. He’s my direct competition in the work I do.  I’ve done good but I feel so hollow when I work. To make things worse my gf if I can still even call her that got hooked on opioids and started stripping behind my back. I found out and tried to cut it off but I’m too attached. Before I knew that I was looking at fucking engagement rings. She started talking sexting these two guy in other areas basically because I started to get healthy and move away from smoking weed and partying all the time. This has made me “basic” in her eyes. So sorry I like to be able to pay bills and shit. She’s in rehab now and I don’t know where the rest of my life is going. She’s says she has to be selfish rn for treatment but that is pretty much all she has done during our nine year relationship. Work is starting to turn sour too. The only thing keeping me alive is my pet and the fact that my mom needs me around (I think) because of her inability to speak. I feel so in the dark. I’ve held an empty gun to my head to feel something but I’m afraid to die but I also hate my day to day life. I want things to be good so bad but they just keep falling apart. I can’t go back to school and I’m pretty much forced to at least keep on this work path rn. I wish she loved me like I love her. I wished a lot of people in my life loved me like I loved them. Tired of being alone.,I had so much hope,1
1710,I think I’m going to give up,To me there is only one way out of this...,1
1711,"My family are extremely religious to put it mildly. Thankfully they believe in medicine, because I'm extremely sick. I'm 24, almost 25 and unable to get out of bed a lot of days. I need a cane to walk. I have to live with my parents because of how sick I am. And it feels like they fucking love it. It didn't use to be this bad, before covid at least I didn't have to go to church because it's not safe for me to. I've been on a chemo drug called Retuximab for well over two years now. Every 3 weeks as of now I need another infusion to keep my b cells gone, cause my body wants to kill me, ironic. 

I'm constantly being brought up in the church my parents are very involved with, as a fucking example. I have to hold in the laughter because the pastor will talk about how I am so sick but by the grace of god I have this medicine that can let me keep on living. Yeah, thanks asshole, maybe could you have just not given me so many autoimmune diseases in the first place? And then they fucking pray for me, and pat themselves on the backs like they are so great. I'm so so so tired of hearing how strong I am. As if I have a fucking choice. Yeah, I'm so strong to lay in a bed for a day every three weeks and get poison infused into my veins, and then practically throw up my organs that night and the next day. Where in that fucking picture am I strong?? I'm fucking embarrassed. Nothing is private, my family shares everything with the church. ""Oh he didn't dry heave as much this time, thank the grace of god"" fuck you. Before covid all I had to do was listen to my parents about how much the church was sEnDiNg ThEy'Re PrAyErS. Now, well isn't covid a little blessing in fucking disguise, now the church is ONLINE too, meaning every single service I get to sit through. I cant even do the ""I'm not feeling well"" legitimate excuse because it's saved on the churches website and we can watch it whenever. 

If you can't tell, I'm not religious. But in a bonus round for reasons for all my family and friends to hate me, I think I'm gay. I don't even fucking know what I am. Half the time I'm nothing because I feel like shit. But I'm just not attracted to women, ever. Sometimes I'm attracted to men though, when I actually feel attracted to anyone. I dont fucking know what label to put on it. Often times I'm just feeling so shit I'm just not sexually turned on by anything. But when I am, it's guys. So I dont know if I'm like asexual and gay, or if it's normal to just not feel any arousal when you're feeling like shit. But it's something I stress over again and again, cause I just have to have something to stress over, brain never let's me be and not be on the edge of a panic attack over nothing. And I know the whole ""you don't have to label anything"" but like, there is no reasoning with panic attacks. If my parents or church found out I'm attracted to guys, well I certainly wouldn't be on the ""prayer list"" or worse, maybe I would be even more so to pray that gOd FiXeS mE as if being attracted to men is the thing I want fixed.

It doesn't matter anyways. I don't know if I'll even out live my parents. And get this, now my immunologist is saying they want to move the infusion to every 15 days. Every 15 god damn days. Looks like christmas came early this year, huh?? That was when I felt the overwhelming sense of ""I'm not going to go on like this, I can't, I'm going to kill myself."" I'm already taking so many medications my side table looks like an elderly persons. It's not even in a nice even pattern. One I have to take 4 times a day, while two I take 3 times a day. One I take twice a day and then three I take once a day. But I have 7 alarms set for medication.

When I got the news about them wanting to move me to 15 days because my cells are growing back faster and I fucking cried. I am going through so many emotions, depression, anxiety, rage, feeling suicidal. I've never felt so much anger in my life, I'm angry at everyone and suicide heels it's little head as an answer to everything. To no more constant pain in my body. No more infusions. No more hearing how fucking ""strong"" I am. No more hearing how my ""fight"" helped fucking church Karen cause of whatever god damn problem she had going on.

So that's my question. Why fight? Why do I keep going to just have more of this life. I'm not going to get better. There is no ""remission"" from autoimmune diseases. This is it. Whether I die in 10 years from now or tomorrow, what is the point? All that is ahead is suffering. There is no getting better, there is NOTHING. I'm never going to find someone who loves me. I'm never going to be well enough to be on my own. Sure, with the constant medication theres no guarantee I die young, I could live 80 miserable fucking years. But what is the point in going on if there is nothing else. I'm alone and getting worse. My arms are so sore even typing this out, how pathetic is that. It is a constant throbbing of that feeling when someone punches you hard in the arm, non stop, from holding up my fucking phone.

I can't move out because I can't do this on my own and I more than anything dont want to be in an assisted care facility. I can't tell my parents about any of this that I'm going through because I'm ashamed and embarrassed and I know how they'll respond. I tell them I'm suicidal? Psych ward. I tell them I think I'm gay? They'd either think I ""dont know what I'm talking about"" or try to ""fix"" me. And if I refuse? The icing on the I want to die cake. This has happened before when I didn't want to facetime the church and refused, they tell me to look for assisted living places. They're manipulative, but they know I dont want to be in an assisted living facility, so I get to be their fucking personal ""pat me on the back"" sign they can wave in church about how amazing they are for helping a sick person. ""Things are hard, but *we* make it through."" Fuck you, I make it through, you leave the room when I start to throw up because you're squeamish. 

What is the point in going on if this is it for the rest of my life. Can't someone pull my fucking cord, cause I'm only alive because of a fuckton of medicine and isn't that what life support boils down to anyways.","I'm not ""strong"" for being sick, I'm on life support and not allowed to touch the cord.",1

nothing has helped me. not hospitals, meds, therapy. nothing. i've. been diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety disorder. they (doctors, therapists) are looking at bipolar, borderline personality disorder and my mom thinks i have PTSD. they can't diagnosed me with certain things because i'm only 14. all of this started happening in the beginning of 2020 when i was 13 and tried to slit my wrists with a razor. before that i tried ODing, drowning, suffocating, jumping out of a moving car, all that jazz. i went to the hospital, then home because i was ""ok"" but then 2 days after that the cops came and took me back to the hospital bc ""i was self-harming in the shower"" when i wasn't actually. i talked to. a social worker and asked her about a residential and she told my mom so my mom sent me there and when i got back home i was still suicidal and depressed so she sent me to a mental hospital. now i'm back and i tried to OD again but still here i'm thinking soon i'm just gonna slit my wrists with a knife or scissors or bring them to school and do it there. no one really cares about me. i'm fine with that tho. i just want to be dead. i don't want to die but i don't want to be alive either so. plus everyone knows i'm gonna do it soon anyways. i'll probably only miss my kitten, my best friend, and my dad. everyone else can kiss my dead ass. so anyways i came on here seeking help or a reason not to die or reason to live or something. because i need one until i can actually kms. nobody's gonna see this anyways haha but at least i tried :)

OK I want to start by telling a little background information about me, 19-year-old male living in the United States in Massachusetts. 

OK I wanna start by saying that I graduated high school but I failed miserably and because I was mostly put in a Special ED class since first grade and they put me in like below average classes because I was doing really horrible academically in math,science and about most subjects in school And I struggle to even understand like I don’t know if I suffer any possible disability or mental issues because I had a hard time understanding things and even when people try to explain it to me I struggle real hard even simple things that doesn’t have to do with school I struggle I have a hard time processing information and understanding even after constant explanations I still don’t get it and my parents have threatened me and said they would not support me in anyway so I mostly had to lie to Doctor and told him I was fine I didn’t have any issues because they would not support or pay for any mental they don’t believe in mental illness at all and think I’m stupid. 

Now that I graduate high school I feel like my life is stuck like I have no passion no interest no skills not any job experience at all I never even had a job and I just don’t know what to do with my life and nothing seems to interest me and everything is just too hard and someone like a dumb kid like me could never do I try but I can never improve I am highly depressed I don’t really wanna go to college because I have my reasons I struggle with subjects and I like we would get kicked out rates and also I have a fear that if even they might not be able to get a job or even keep it because I might fuck up and get myself fired constantly I struggle with subjects and I like we would get kicked out due poor grades and parents not supporting m and also I have a fear that I might not be able to get a job or even keep it because I might fuck up and get myself fired constantly or can’t pass interview.","[Need Advice] 19m Failed school no job experience no talent no skills and highly depressed and feeling like life is going nowhere, also getting kicked out our parents house forever.",1

Took a lot of pills both times and was treated almost immediately so I survived both times. I have a 4yo son that right now is the main motivation for me to fight. It an exhausting fight, every day, every minute. A lonesome fight. I have left but maybe 2 real friends that still listen to me every now and then.

I blamed my teacher for the drop of my grades and for making me have those thoughts then, but now I know that I am at fault.

I wake up feeling depressed every morning, but I refuse to face the reality. I want to end my life, but how that will affect my family concerns me.

I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time

I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. 

I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall 

I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. 

I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die? 

I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life

I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing

I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time

I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one

I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head

I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands

I'm 28 years old, working a dead end job, with no degree, and chances are I'll never finish one and will continue working a dead end job basically forever. Or, I might finish the degree I'm working on right now... and go into a field I absolutely fucking hate. So either way, I'll end up miserable. And well, as much as I know I shouldn't, I can't help but compare myself to my sister and my best friend - both with either multiple children or a child on the way, being super damn successful (one is a university professor, the other an anesthesiologist), and me, with the same damn opportunities, can barely keep my head above water. I don't know if I'm just fucking stupid or what, but I squandered the exact same opportunities that they had and now I'm basically fucked forever.

And then on top of that, there's the fact that well - I'm basically unlovable at this point. Even my parents and my ex wife told me that on multiple occasions - there's basically nothing worth loving here. And well, I can't really disagree with them. I'm a complete drag on everyone who's around me, and I contribute nothing in any way, shape, or form. Whenever anyone puts space between me and them, their life improves immeasurably. 

&amp;#x200B;

And lastly, well, I just don't see the point. I don't enjoy anything about life anymore. I hate my job, I hate where I live, I hate everything I'm studying in school, I hate my very existence.

They say be patient and and rely on hope but man I can’t do it anymore. I’m fed up of relationships/flings that are just bandages, hanging with friends cool but as soon as I get home the pain comes back. 

My ex tells me she wishes things ended differently but doesn’t want to work it out. I try to get it to work. But I can tell from her responses and lack Therof she’s telling me “lol get over it man”

1784,"made this account earlier tonight because i was looking to find other people as suicidal as me.

i’m pretty sure i’m crazy, no matter how hard i try to feel something i can’t anymore, i never thought i would make it to my 18th birthday but i did recently. it didn’t feel nearly as satisfying as i thought it would and honestly it just feels really pointless. 

i’ve been suicidal since i was 11. for the past 6 1/2 years my closest friend was the reason i stayed alive, that i wouldn’t even want to hurt him to that extent because in all honesty i would do anything in this world to make sure he was okay and well. but ever since one of the first girls i was seriously committed to commit suicide earlier this year we stopped talking because i isolated myself and he didn’t know how to talk to me about it/ didn’t want to upset me at the wrong time. but it’s turned into us barely talking and i no longer feel like a priority in his life and i feel really empty

i’ve only been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and my old therapist (i ghosted him after her suicide) mentioned to me that i have intrusive thoughts and signs of bpd but not enough to be actually diagnosed. 

i’ve never really wanted to be alive since i was little, i wanted to cut my stomach off with scissors since the age of 10, now i’m almost at my body goal and that’s all i’m really waiting for to do it because i refuse to die fat lol, also i’m waiting for another “traumatic enough” incident to happen or for my sister to tell me to kill myself again like she did when i was 12 so my dad doesn’t blame it on him, i’m his only actual child i know it would break him but it’s become harder and harder to function in my own mind and i’m miserable whenever i’m not being distracted

i’ll most likely do it in January after i get to visit all of my friends for the last time, do it as an overdose as my last attempts went, it’s the most peaceful way to go in my opinion the past few times i just fell into a deep sleep and woke up with someone holding me over a toilet but i’ll make sure to do it right this time",just wanna say goodbye,1
1785,"So, i know nobody takes pleasure in talking or hearing about depression. I, myself, am bothered by my own sad, pathetic thoughts, so, natually, i bottle up irl, but i thought i'd get my thoughts sorted out here.
I'll soon be 18 and, the thing is, i already feel like i'm getting old without making any valuable memories, like i'm a master at wasting time. 


Many people say 'What are you talking about! Life is just about to start, you're still young, you have all the time ahead'  but i know myself, and i'm just a lonely, anxious, ugly wreck, with little to no personality. I don't get invited to parties, i can't sing. I have no photo of myself on any social media (not even as a pfp), and people surely don't offer to take pictures with me, ever.


I only have about two people to call 'close friends' (one of whom i've only known on the internet), with no one to consider me their best friend. I haven't even had a first kiss (i'd add 'yet' but, who am i laughing at, it's not gonna happen). 


I don't live in a big city - quite the opposite, actually, so that little optimistic part of myself likes to think that things would be different if i lived somewhere else. Like, if i went to college, maybe i'd meet someone there (a boy or, heck, even a girl, i'll become a lesbian if that's what it takes to find 'the one'), fall in love maybe, have my heart broken at least, experience anything romantic.

Maybe i'd make friends with my roommates and then with my roommates' friends and stop being the 'isolated one'. Maybe i'll visit places. Make memories.
But i feel like that won't happen, not with Covid, anyway. Just thinking that i'll probably end up taking online classes in college is such a depressing thought, i'd rather just not apply.
My motivation right now is somewhere below sea level.


But mainly it's the loneliness that's killing me. Or rather the thought that i'm never anyone's first choice. I feel like my friends only talk to me when their better friends are not around (lately i've been kept on seen on a daily basis, i only get to talk to my internet friend for about 5 minutes a day - and i'm trying my best not to be dull, our conversations are actually interesting and fun - but soon she just stops responding, and she keeps being online for hours. It's breaking my heart, she's great and i feel like i'm not good enough of a friend).

I truly believed that if you worked hard, if you treated people in a good way there would be a reward down the line. Whatever hope I had is now gone, and I realize there's nothing more to this life than what is. 

I'm not one to give up, I never have been. But even I, with my stubbornness, have to admit that I've failed. I feel defeated and hopeless. It's funny, I've spent y whole life fearing defeat. But now, that it has come it's not as bad as I thought. I've accepted my faith. If I could do it all over, I would. And I would be better towards myself. But you can't and you play with the hand you're dealt. 

I learned to late to stay in my lane. My plate was set and my place in society and life was already decided. I could've just accepted it and maybe been happy. Instead i over-reached and I now find myself where I am. My life reminds me of the soldier that only has to be quiet and leave in the darkness to live his life happy and full. Instead, he accepts a challenge, knowing he will never win. So, like that confused soldier I stepped out on the battlefield, filled my head with thoughts of success and failed miserably. But it's OK. I've accepted my fate, I truly have. Maybe there was a way for me to be happy, but I never saw it and no one never pointed it out for me. I'm not sad for myself. I'm not. This is what I deserve, and I truly believe this is how it would always end. I'm sad for the people I leave behind, the ones that will feel this is their failure. The ones that will think that maybe they could've done something different. They couldn't. I hope some day, they find this and understand that this is not on them. They've done nothing wrong, and they have been amazing people. I am the problem. I am faulty, not them. I love them, but I have to move on. 

This will be the last I ever write on Reddit. I hope other people out there find their way, but I failed. 

So with this, I want to let you know I'm throwing in the towel. I'm leaving everything and everyone behind. I don't know what's on the other side, but it can't be as bad as this.",Goodbye,1
1800,"Hello.
Thank you for reading this. I’m posting on my phone. I am thinking of going to my garage and leaving the car on so I can die by suffocation. 

I recently got dumped by someone who I thought was a great partner. I posted here before and well...not much has changed. My friends abandoned me after my toxic relationship ended and picked my toxic ex over me. I never found new friends - I just clung onto the one friend I had left. I overburden him. I never found a stable romantic relationship. I thought I did because I got hopeful things can work. I think it’s time I learned there is no hope for me. 

My work has suffered from my loneliness and I feel burnt out. I don’t feel any hope or desire to keep going. There is no point. My light is extinguished.

1806,"I'm 14 and i got sexually harassed 3 times in my life. 2 of them was stranger at public place and 1 of them is my uncle who's my mom's brother. Since the day I was sexually harassed by my uncle, I have nightmare and non stop suicide thoughts. Everytime my family went back to my grandma's house (since he lives w my grandma) I keep thinking that I should either kill me or him. I told my sisters and brothers about this, but they just told me to hang in there since my mom loves his brother more than her childrens. Recently in July, my Dad and My mom found out. As expected, my mom didn't took this seriously. She said It's nothing serious and just told me that I'm overthinking. But my dad told me that he disagree w my mom. I went to psych hosp after a year since i stopped going there August last year.  And the doctor suggested that I should report to police but i think about my mom and my relatives. I afraid they'll hate me bcoz all of them have same thinking abt my mom. During my 14th birthday on 23rd August, I supposedly go to psych hosp, but my mom insisted to go to our grandma's house first. I was thinking about killing my mom that time. But we still went there. and shits happened i saw my uncle i got panic attack and My dad quickly bring me to psych hospital but our appointment was cancelled that day?? And my dad still want to report to police. but i cried and i say no, I think about my uncle's childrens and wife, I'm afraid they will hate me. We went back home and since August I tried to attempt suicide many times but I'm still didn't die yet. My mom go to counseling and she slowly showing me support. But I still doubt my mom, and even my family who's showing me support now. Four days ago, I attempted suicide again by overdosing sleeping pills, but I failed again. Since then my family treated me as I was a crazy person. I still doubting my mom that she cares for me and I hate myself for it. But after all what my mom did to me in the past, It's almost impossible to trust her 100% yet. My sisters that I thought I can trust, was talking behind my back by calling me crazy for attempting suicide. I am sad. And I will try again, to kill myself. I've been searching everywhere how to die, and I found this club??? or group?? And i hope someone helps me how to remove these suicide thoughts and negative thoughts about my mom.  I'm still doubting her but after all I'm her daughter?? And i felt really guilty for feeling like this towards my mom. Please help me :( I hate myself so much day by day that sometimes I even thought that I'm the one who's wrong in the sexual harassment last year not my uncle. I always thought like that. I've been going to psych hosp but they never ask me if i ever thought about suicide. Should i tell them?",I still doubt my mom,1

I've made up my mind. I'm sick of never knowing when the blackouts are coming. I'm sick of seeing everyone dead when I close my eyes. I'm sick of the voices telling me I'm worthless. I'm sick of cops screaming and hitting me when I ask for help. I'm sick of doctors and therapists that won't do anything to help me. I'm sick of my family telling me to just stop being a pussy. I'm sick of being sick. I'm sick of being in pain.

If I'm not allowed to get better, I'm just going to kill myself. I don't want your bullshit about how it gets better, it doesn't. It doesn't get better, I've been waiting, I've given it time. I've asked for help in every where I know how. I call the numbers, I text the lines, I go to the hospital, all just to be patronized and walked on. There is no help available, it's just a lie that the upper class tells to make themselves feel better. Mental health treatment is nothing but ridicule and bills no one can pay.

1822,"I finally gave therapy a shot after dealing with depression for a few years after not being able to hide it from the people around me (typically can fake happiness and normalcy pretty well). Everyone around me that has felt with depression or anxiety sees a therapist and I’m happy that there’s less of a stigma about it these days. However, I knew it would not work for me. My thought and feelings are just too dark. How am I supposed to trust a stranger with these thoughts when I don’t even burden my family and friends with them? 

Anyways, after giving therapy a shot I can say I should’ve trusted my initial instinct.Let’s just say my first session included a lot of crying and an intervention with another psychiatrist insisting I share my suicide plans when I stated I wasn’t ready to do so. I lost trust just as quickly as I gave it, so my next few session I made myself shut up, explain “I’m not feeling great but I’m doing okay” just as I tell everyone else in my life. I take my anti depressants and I shut up.

Maybe it’s ignorant for me to say this but it’s just my perspective: therapy is great for people that want to talk through their problems and have someone acknowledge it’s ok to be sad. Maybe they even get put on some meds and then it’s just a check in on their mental health. However, if you’re in a true depression, talking it out isn’t gonna help and it may even hurt you. I think this is why I can’t relate to some other people’s versions of depression.

1844,"I'm 21. Have no career goals or aspirations. If you asked me what my dream job is I couldn't tell you. I'm in college doing bullshit online classes because of this Covid shit, not learning a damn thing because these professors are retarded, and trying to get a bullshit psych degree so I can try to just find some kind of decent job. But I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. My friend circle is slowly shrinking, my mental health is getting worse, I'm lonely, never had a girlfriend, work a job where I feel taken advantage of and unvalued, and just all around hate every aspect of my life as it is. The only reason I'm still here is because of my parents. I'm an only child, and despite the fact that I have basically wasted everything that they worked so hard to give me I couldn't bring myself to do that to them. Especially my mother. I'm not quite ready to go yet, but I'm reeeeeeealy getting there.

 I already told my mother that once she and Dad are gone then I'll have nothing left and will likely kill myself. I felt bad telling her that, but I felt like I had to. I don't see my life getting any better. Every time I think it will it just gets worse. Everyone tells me to try to be optimistic, but every time I try to see the brighter side of things something bad happens that just completely brings me back down. Every day I finally feel better I just end up back in a slump.

I feel like such a burden on my poor 60 year old mother, but I never do anything to change that. I just keep doing the same shit everyday. The most painful thing for me to hear is that my parents are proud of me and that they love me. Because I see me for what I truly am, and I'm not something to be proud of and I'm not a loveable person. I'm a bad person.

1845,"Been dealing with depression since I was 15 and it has always come w/ suicidal thoughts.  I’ll go periods where I get myself out of the funk and be happy and doing well but I am constantly battling this.  

I am an Engineering student and lately I’ve felt like I keep fucking everything up and it’s starting to spiral.  I was recently exposed to covid and as a result I am currently stuck in my room twiddling my fucking hands.  I’m not allowed to leave.  I feel trapped.  

I just got a gf and it’s been amazing but after a week of being in this fucking room, I hurt her.  We were talking on the phone and I said something extremely tone deaf and mean and now I don’t know if she will forgive me.  It was an accident of course, and I didn’t think before I said it I just blurted it out, but now she will barely speak to me.  She’s hurting a lot and I fear I fucked everything up.

On top of that, as an Engineering student, I’m starting to not do as great at it.  I’m a senior and the last couple years I had done well, but I’m so burnt out by it now and I’m just suffering through it.  My professors won’t let up it’s terrible.  I’m not doing as well because I’m having a harder time staying focused because I’m not enjoying it as much now.  It just feels miserable at this point and I’m lacking the motivation.

I haven’t been lifting as much lately.  Normally I’m pretty into fitness and it steadily helps my mind but because of school and work I can’t take the time.  Fkn sucks.

Just got laid off from my job during school cuz of COVID and don’t know if I can find another one as of right now.

Basically I want to fucking die right now.  I can’t sleep, I’m barley eating, I don’t give a fuck about anything and I don’t really care to be living.  I fucked up things with the best thing that has happened to me in a long time and now she wonders if this is how I truly am.

1848,"I graduated college two years ago and have been unemployed until recently. I was extremely excited to finally be back to work so I would be able to take care of myself and save money until my first day at the job I was getting chewed out for not working fast enough. I work at a major retail company prepping orders to be shipped so I understand the working with a sense of urgency is a must. I wasn't even finished training yet. The very next shift I got chewed out again despite still taking time to figure stuff out. Since then they've cut my hours down to 12 a week. I don't know how I'm supposed to pay any bills on that. I applied for another job and got it. They said they would let me know when I could start. It's been quite a while since I've heard from them despite multiple attempts to get into contact with them. This job isn't anything special. It is a minimum wage job that I can work until I can find a more stable career type job. They still haven't contacted me about it.

My car has a running list of things that need fixed asap, but I have no money to do so. While I didn't graduate school with student loan debt, I have a credit card that is maxed out from covering the last semester of school. Looking back now I shouldn't have even finished that semester because my degree hasn't helped me get a job at all. In fact it has made it harder to even get minimum wage jobs. I've tried all the advice (it's about how you sell yourself, market the skills your degree taught you, blah blah blah) and it doesn't help. I worked my way through college in various offices on campus and did a lot of extra things and apparently none of that work experience qualifies because it wasn't full time work. I was supposed to go to graduate school. I've actually gotten into a couple of them with a vague promise that I would have some type of funding. All the schools rescinded their offers for any type of funding so I didn't get to go despite wanting to achieve my dreams. I'm told if they really are my dreams taking out $60k in loans shouldn't matter, but that just seems irresponsible to me since I'm already having a hard time finding a job without student loans. Anytime I try to figure out what I'm supposed to do with my life it seems like everything falls through.

Not only all of this, but my boyfriend and I have been having major problems. We had broken up and decided to try to work on things, but it feels like I'm the only one putting any effort in to fix our issues. He just sweeps everything under the rug and acts like everything is fine when it isn't. If I try to talk to him about anything going on he gets mad that I keep bringing up stuff from the past. Like, no duh we have problems we need to work on.  I've noticed that is how it is with all of my relationships. My friends and family are the same way. I'm always the one going out of my way to contact others to ask them how they're doing. It's always me going to see them. It's always me that is expected to put in so much more effort than them and I don't get why.

In general I feel like I have to put in so much work to try to make things work out and they never do. I know I should mind my business, but it's hard to when I have friends from college who have amazing careers and are buying new houses. Things just work out for them so much easier and I don't get why I don't have the same luck. My friend who graduated college with me only applied to one job which she got. I'm super happy for her, but I don't understand why I struggle so much.

What's the point anymore? I spin my wheels to stay exactly where I'm at. I don't want to bother anymore. What's the point of life if every time I get somewhere close to happy life goes to shit again? I don't understand the point. Life has no meaning. It's just a bunch of BS and then we die. Can it just please be over already?

All there is in life is sadness. Yes, there are other emotions you experience but they always come to an end, as all good things do. Except sadness, sadness stays. The first thing you do when you are born, is cry. Then as you mature you cry at less random times. Finally when your brain is fully developed, you barely ever cry. But that doesn’t mean that you are happy for the rest of your life. No no no rather, there is even more sadness. You can fully process your emotions to the point where none of them come as a surprise. You expect to be happy, mad, scared, or sad. But you don’t cry because you know it is coming, but what you don't realize is that it will never end. You are happy all week and then BOOM! *One* bad thing happens and then you are ruined- sad. The worst part is that the longer you are happy for, the worse the feelings will be when it's sadness’s turn again. You might say that sadness is only temporary but that's where you’re wrong. It might occur for a short while, but it always comes back. Sadness is like a cold, it sucks when you have it but it doesn’t last that long. Even though it doesn’t last long- it **always** comes back. There isn’t always someone there to help you along. And usually when there is, you just push them away even if you don’t mean/want to. They try and try and you just don’t let them in but not even that deep down all you want is for them to come back and tell you that everything is going to be ok and that they love you and care about you and will always be there for you but… That's not what happens. They keep trying to help and you don’t let them so they do what any reasonable person would do and give up.  Nothing hurts more, than when someone that you care about and you thought cared about you, just walks away. It’s almost a physical manifestation of your last shred of hope in life literally just leaving you. You physically couldn’t get it to stay even though you wanted it to but you couldn’t because of- sadness. Done, your last bit of hope gone. The only thing standing between you and the end is cowardice. You are to SCARED to do it. You know you want to, but you can't bring yourself to. So all you can do is keep going with all the pain and sadness and loss of hope and just gain a new hope. A hope that one day it will all catch up with you and you won’t be scared anymore. Not a hope that you will exit the depths of sadness and suicide, no no no, you are too far gone for that. It’s not even an option anymore. The only thing you can do is *hope* that one day you’ll do it. And it will all be over.",All there is in life is sadness,1

I left bc I didn’t realize what I was putting you through. I was so caught up in my own hurt and bullshit that you were putting on me, I didn’t even realize I was hurting you. I hurt the person I love most. I was hurting you. I kept hurting you. I was so preoccupied I didn’t even notice. 
I don’t even want to see what my life is like without you. I know what your life is like without me: movies, friends, work, girls. Most importantly: fun. You have fun. You have friends.

I’m sorry for it all, I wish I could wake up feeling better and believing that things could Infact be better but I just know it can’t. I’ve not been happy with my life for a long period of time, and anytime I do get happiness, Every time I bring someone good in to my life, someone that genuinely makes me happy and someone I would do anything to make happy, I find some way to hurt them a lot, my fucked up thoughts and worries ruin things and makes me in to a selfish obsessed arsehole who breaks people’s trust, treats them like shit and ultimately shows them that they’d be better off without me. I let the same problems that have been engrained in to me flood over and I push people to the point where they no longer see the value in me being in their life, and I truly don’t blame them. I don’t value me so it’s not surprising that the people I treat like shit don’t either. I am an awful person, I’ve treated the few people who I was so lucky to have close to me, all so disgustingly bad, saying and doing things that wouldn’t be expected of someone who is meant to care for someone. There isn’t an excuse, mental health isn’t an excuse to treat anyone badly or be a toxic horrible person. I destroy relationships, I do it through my own selfish means without even realising I’m doing it half the time, I subconsciously am an awful person, people welcome me in to their life and I fuck it up time and time again. Every single person who has been with me is now happier without me in their life, their life’s actually improved when I wasn’t in it. That’s so unbelievably telling of the person I am and the things I do. It doesn’t matter how many chances I’m offered, I always never learn and I continue to say disgustingly stupid things that I don’t mean, but I don’t think about the things I say I just say them without the social awareness to understand how they come across, I do it so much all the time and all it does is hurt people. This isn’t a self pity thing where I feel not good enough or feel like no one cares or understands me, it’s that people do care but I hurt them and treat them in such awful ways that they can’t have me in their life anymore, for their own sake. I’m not a good person, I’m a fucking awful person. So why spend time trying to improve myself when I don’t even believe that anything will work to change me, and then eventually end up hurting someone else? Nothing will change who I am. I’m an emotional manipulator, a controller and a horrible fucking person. I abuse people and it’s really that simple. I don’t know why I do the terrible things I do, but I don’t blame anyone for not wanting me in their life, I wouldn’t want me in it either. No amount of therapy, self help books, medication or “learning from your past” will change that because I just keep doing it and even though I try everything I can to change, it still happens. Why should I need a book, CBT, DBT you name what ever kind of therapy you want, just to function like a normal person? To treat people normally, to not act out in incredibly awful ways? Why can’t I just be normal?  Most people go through their life having friends, relationships, family members that they never treat like shit, who never act in such awful ways who don’t need therapy, medication, self help to get better or to just be better. I’m not normal, I’m this way because that’s the person I am, and the only person who can actually change me Is me, but I’ve tried time and time again, Im done trying to pretend I’ll ever be anything other than an awful, horrible, deceptive, manipulative piece of shit. My life has literally been littered with shame and guilt and no matter how bad I want to change or how much I try the same things keep happening, I keep pushing away and hurting the people I care so much about. It always gets to the point where I’ve hurt the person I love too much and they need to leave my life for their own good or my issues are so deep ridden that I’ll never be that person they want me to be, I just hurt people and have never been worth it to anyone, and I can’t blame them. I never felt good enough growing up, not from anyone, my family, my parents I always felt like I was letting down or annoying, always falling out with and arguing with and I’m sorry that I was never the child you wanted me to be, it shows I was born that way, it’s me I’m the problem, my brother ive never been close with or talked to really, didn’t have many friends at school and the few I did either cut me out their life when they met better ones and the one person that stayed I pushed away by treating him awfully, and the couple of friends I have now, I fear doing the same to. I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again and the truth is everyone is better with me not in their life they just haven’t realised it yet. No relationships should have the amount of problems I bring to them, 4 years, 1 and a half years or two months it doesn’t matter, I bring an abundance of toxicity and pain to them and I don’t think that will ever change, I’m sorry to those who have experienced that first hand and the shit I did to you, the tears I brought you, the relentless problems. You wanted me in your life but eventually realised I’m not the person you thought I was. It’s just who I am, internally. I’m thankful for the experiences and happiness that these people have brought me but truly sorry and ashamed for the damage I’ve done. For not repaying your love and support. I bring no positive qualities to people’s life’s and never will, I bring no positive qualities to my own life and never will. Its soul destroying. I wish I wasn’t me and I can’t continue to live, being me. I’m honestly sorry to anyone this hurts by the decision to do this, I wanted to be normal, I wish I could be so fucking badly but I’m just not, i never will be. I’m honestly a weirdo, an unsociable freak. I make decisions, awful decisions, awful reactions to situations that no one in their right mind would make, I’ve always done it and I always will because I’m fucked in the head. Everyday to me feels the exact same and has for nearly 2 months now, I’m trapped literally reliving all the awful things I did to people and the fact my life consists of the same shit everyday right now is a product of that. A product of me. Even though I don’t want to hurt people, yet I do time and time again, all of my life has consisted of losing people who mean a lot to me and realise they are better off. I’ve never had many friends or people I felt connected to, always felt in a way isolated and it’s not that crazy that when I meet someone I love that I expect too much from them, I become clingy and pushy, I am extremely selfish, I’m a horrible person by nature. So many people have left my life and been better off, while every time I’m left facing me and the reality of it all, I don’t have anything worth it. Nothing I do gives me purpose, and anything that does make me happy I ruin. I feel so empty so pointless, literally nothing makes me happy or matters to me, and it’s so bad because it should, I should care and be happy but I’m not, I have a car, one year off a degree, stable job and money but that’s never mattered to me, I’ve never taken the opportunities to make a friend group, I wake up everyday to no texts or messages from anyone because I’m not a fun person to have in someone’s life, other people are. I get told over and over that I need to learn to be alone, but I’ve been alone my entire life I don’t do things that people my age should be doing or things I want to do because having people to do them with is what makes them special and matter. I’m sick of being alone. literally my entire life has been me being my only real friend, and anyone who does come in to my life I push away or isolate myself from them because I know I’ll eventually hurt them. Any social interaction I’m invited to or I’m part of I act like a controlling manipulative weirdo and want to make it all about me, no one wants me in their life and it’s not that hard to see why, I’m not someone is fun to be around or have in life. Im an embarrassment to people and I’m an embarrassment to myself, I wake up every day alone to do the same stuff over and over again, just trying to get to the next day, why would anyone want that? Everyday I want to die because this is not the person I ever wanted to be, or how I ever wanted to treat people, but it’s the reality of it. I’ve always had the idea to move country and get away, start my life again, but I’ve done that in certain aspects and I’ve fucked it up time and time again, the same stuff keeps happening, because the issue isn’t other people, it’s me. When people come in to my life they wonder why I do the certain things I do why my social media is so sparse, why I’m not out with people as much why I don’t have many friends, why I spend so much time on places like Reddit and I’m focused so much on self help, it’s because Its an escape to the reality of my life, about not wanting to be me and realising that there really aren’t many people in my life that see me as important to them or would consider me a good friend. It’s always been like that, I’ve always felt different from the rest and always been alone, it’s probably a big reason why I cling so much on to relationships because without that, I have virtually no social interaction and losing that person is literally losing everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m alone in life because I’m not good to have in others life’s, that’s been made clear to me time and time again. When I hurt someone like I have to people I’ve been lucky enough to love, I just choose to remove myself from their life at this point because it’s clear they’d be so much better off, forgetting ever meeting me, I’m a negative thing in their life and I can’t blame them for thinking that, it’s been that way my entire life, being someone that hinders people’s life’s, not benefits them. It’s why I have nothing. Im a hurdle to a happier life for them. I always was left feeling wonder why I never experienced anything with family when people spend so much time with their parents and get along with them, doing so much with friends being able to socialise and just be wanted by others, I’ve never had that and don’t think I ever will, I’m not deserving of it ive had chances to get that life I always wanted but being 25 and seeing where I am and how the same patterns continue and continue, it’s not worth the amount of serious therapy, medication everything to potentially be better, it won’t ever happen, I’m scared of being 30 35 40 or older and still having the same problems over and over, that’s not a life I Want to live, it’s never been. Should anyone go through life trying their hardest to not be the person they are? Is that a way to live? Waking up everyday trying to not be you? That’s been me my entire life, imagining, dreaming and sometimes praying to be someone different to be a person who has a life worth living, something about myself to make me care for the life I live with people who make me happy and who I can experience so much with. I’m tired of all of this pain and loneliness, it’s constantly realising I’m never gonna live that life I wanted and be with the people I do, because I’ll just hurt and hurt over and over again. I’m not happy being me and can’t imagine I ever will be, I live each day thinking about my past and the happiness I had and how I find ways each time to destroy it and that’s an issue with me as a person. I wish that things were different and my life wasn’t a continued feeling of regret and hate for myself but it’s not. I hate everything I’ve done, the way I let myself be and I just can’t keep waking up with the overbearing shame of it all. No matter how hard I try, the amount of effort, emotionally and mentally to be a better person, the person I want to be, it never changes. I repeat the same selfish, manipulative patters every time. This isn’t a case of just pushing through this hard time because I’ve tried to distract myself, meeting people, watching tv, playing games, going out walks talking to my grandparents and everything you are supposed to do in hard times, but my life has been this constant feeling of being unwanted and lack of identity, I don’t know who I am or what matters to me, the only times I’ve ever felt truly myself and happy is when I am with those that I love and to have people that mean so much to me, and holding out hope that a person like that will once again appear in my life isn’t worth all this constant hate for myself. I mentally and physically just can’t do this anymore, hurting people I care about and put so much in to loving, and then have them leave my life. It hurts so much to care so much about someone, to try your hardest to be the best person you can be, and yet continue to fuck it all up, because you can’t change. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, and going on living each day wishing I wasn’t me isn’t something I want to do anymore. My constant thoughts each day are of the people I’ve hurt and lost due to my actions and just how fucking weird and horrible I am, I don’t want to keep doing that, I can’t justify it in anyway. I don’t see how anyone could ever love someone so fucked up. No one deserves to be treated the way I treated people. I sincerely hope they live a happy life, they absolutely deserve it, because even though it all ended through me being so horrible to them, they brought me happiness that meant the world to me, genuinely. This isn’t anyone’s fault but mine so please don’t feel guilty for it, no one can save me from myself or the things I do over and over again, so please don’t look for someone or something to blame, this was my decision, something I caused and created and this is the only thing I’ve felt sure about. I’m really sorry I wish I was a better, different person, but I’ll never be the person I want to be or how I want to be for others.","Plans are made, I’m ready to go, never thought I’d not make it past 25",1

They sleep on the floor of the living room, rarely shower, makes rude comments, having breakdowns where they hit themselves, cry randomly, etc. While all this intense stuff is going on at home I have a unpaid internship I go to so I can get a real job. I have no money and get fired the first week of my real job.

Anyways. I met a friend on here who I really clicked with. We talked for 8 fucking hours of VC on discord.

They asked so much about me. And I said so much about me. I felt a connection. All this came crumbling down when they said “Do you think you’d get bored of someone even if they were perfect?” And I explained I may need a few day break from the relationship after a while.

He got fucking pissed. Pissed! And telling me I’m always contradicting myself and he thought we wanted the same thing. I’m now fucking crying because I can’t lose someone else.

I tried to explain, but he was having none of it. So I roll over and just feel myself get tired. We’re still arguing, and he asks “Are you going to bed?” And I say no.

I kept apologizing and crying pathetically because I’m a worthless manipulative bitch, right? And he goes on to say he’s going to unfriend me. My toxic bitch brain did NOT like that.

I start BEGGING him to stay. Crying and whimpering and just being gross. He finally says he will, and I kept asking him to please not lie and to promise (I think I was age regressing at this point from stress?).

Anyways, he keeps asking questions and my stupid bitch self kept replying. Cue to him asking me why I’m making such a show. I explained I had never begged anyone to stay before, and he doubted that, he doubted that even after knowing about my past abusive relationships! He also told me that the math I’m doing in school is some “baby level” and regardless of my grades (I have above A- in EVERY class) I’m definitely not going to med school. He’s right. Why would they want me?

Well, he then asked me if I thought I was toxic, and I hate myself, so I said yes. He then replied, “Yeah, you’re pretty toxic, and hangs up and unfriends me. The fucking panic attack after was unreal.

I have gotten like 2 hours of sleep. I fucking cared about him. And he commented on how I clearly am not available cause my main has a bunch of vents on it. I deleted those vents. I clearly don’t deserve to even be treated like a person.

I’ll be going to sleep after I’ve posted this. Being depressed and suicidal is *exhausting*. 

This year has been a shit show for me, not including Covid and I’m just so tired.  Whenever I feel like I’ve got back on my feet, somethings knocks me down and I don’t have the mental strength to keep pushing forward. 

I sleep a lot to stop myself from having to deal with life but also as a coping mechanism to deal with the suicidal thoughts which can be so loud sometimes. 

My mental health issues come down to the fact I hate myself. I’ve never been good enough for anyone and I feel I am unworthy of any kind of love or kindness. I know it’s wrong to feel like this but here I am. I can explain how much I hate myself. I can’t look at myself in the mirror. 

I’m probably going to lose my job soon due to health issues and I can’t see how anyone else will hire me given my history. No job, means no money and no way of supporting myself. I could lose everything. 

I feel trapped and don’t know what else to do. 

I did speak to my doctor who has given me an antidepressant, which I picked up today but it could be weeks before I feel any benefit from them.

1902,"When I’ve lost my sense of self, is it even accurate anymore to call it ‘suicide’? When there is no *me* left to kill. I’m already gone. I’ve been gone. For longer than it feels fair to have been. 

If this were any other disease... Any other disease would have the decency to destroy my body on its own. But Depression is going to make me do it’s dirty work for it. And no one else understands. Not now. Not afterwards. If it were any other disease it would eventually get to a point where they’d acknowledge that there was nothing more that could be done. That death was inevitable and I didn’t have to fight anymore. And everyone could try to start accepting it and make it an easier transition all around. 

But not Depression. Instead there are platitudes that suicide is “a permanent solution to a temporary problem.” So how long? How long does it have to last before it’s no longer temporary? Because it hurts and I’m so tired of not having anything. Oh, I know I have a lot to live for. Except it doesn’t help. It doesn’t fill the aching void that has rotted away all that I ever was. My love for life. My hope. And I love so much about life but I can’t *feel* any of that anymore. And it is literally killing me. It’s just a matter of time... So how much time? How long am I expected to keep going through the motions without a purpose? 

And for all of the “erase the stigma” rhetoric... I’ll still just be another person who had so much to live for but killed herself. Who didn’t fight quite hard enough. No one ever says the cancer patient who’d battled their disease for years never fought quite hard enough. Yeah, sure, I’ve had periods of remission. But this relapse now is years ongoing. And I hate myself for feeling this way. Like I have a choice. As if haven’t been trying. As if we haven’t been tweaking meds. Which help for a time, but never all the way, before also plateauing. 

And I schnuggled my “babies” tonight so closely... They believe so much in me. Think I’m enough just by being here. My eldest is seven. He’s so sweet and sensitive. A little smart Alec side to him, but he’s my cuddler. But even our crazy three-year old... Last year when I was in the hospital for two weeks it was so hard on them. My husband too. And I go back and forth. I know I’m hardly doing anything just being around. But when I was discharged my husband said just having me here meant so much to all of them. And I do believe him. But just being here like this is so hard for me. And it’s not getting better. And I schnuggled my babies and hate myself for thinking about leaving them. Obviously forever is harder than two weeks. (My husband’s mother died from cancer when he was seven. So I’d be putting our kids through losing their mom, and him all over over again in a way. But yet no one ever blamed her for dying, whereas they would me.) Are they enough reason for me to stay? I hate feeling empty to begin with. I hate myself for Depression winning. I hate it gradually forcing my hand. I hate that there’s an illusion of me still having a choice. It’s no different than any other disease attacking my body, but people are going to look at it as if I made a choice. Are they enough for my to stay? I hate myself for even asking that. They’re absolutely worth everything to me. But is that what remains of my life? To be here just for someone else? I want to actually *be* here though. I want to live rather than merely exist. And if it’s only existing, I can’t do that. And I’m sorry everyone. But that hurts too much. 

I hate that they may have gotten a predisposition for Depression from me. It was the cancer gene we were worried about. But now I’m more worried about this stealing their joy. They’re such happy kids and I hate that I can’t feel that with them. They deserve a Mummy who’s present when she’s around. But kids who lose a parent to suicide are at greater risk for suicide themselves. Especially if it happens before they’re 18. So can I wait 15 more years? When trying just one more day at a time gets harder and harder? 

No decision yet. Well, about when or where or how. I’m fairly certain though this will be how I die. I just... I feel that, even if I don’t know more right now. And I know when it happens Depression will have already killed enough of me that it won’t actually be ‘suicide’.",Is it really suicide?,1

I’ve though about suicide a lot the past 10 years, but I’ve always told someone to save myself. But lately I’ve been planning my death and felt peace with it. I know I want to do it. I’m just afraid of the pain.

And people always tell me: “you’re still young, you’ll have so much that you’ll miss.”

But what will I miss? My depression is 98% chronically, I’ve tried every kind of therapy this crappy world has to offer. So I’ll probably miss a miserably 60 years.

And maybe I would find someone if I’d stay. But I don’t see any point of life. You live to die. End when you die, all your actions are literally forgotten by 99.99% of the world.

1917,"Warning: Very long, ranty vent, I just needed to get this out somewhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Context I'm a 19-year-old college sophomore. 

I went into college as a hopeful music performance major. I had played all four years of high school and I wasn't the best player but I was hopeful that if I just grinded it out I'd get good enough to make something out of it. I was hesitant to do this since I wasn't exactly do or die about music but it was the closest thing I had to a ""passion"" and wasn't particularly adept or interested in any other subjects so I went for it. I made this decision pretty last minute so I hadn't auditioned for any programs and wasn't technically a music major upon entering college. But,  I figured I'd wing it hope for the best.

At first, I was extremely optimistic but after grinding to try to catch up to my peers for 6 months straight it had become clear that I was still very far behind and wasn't living up to the expectations of teachers. I started losing motivation practice and quickly fell even further behind. After talking one on one with a teacher I decided that I needed to leave music behind and look for something else. 

After I left music behind I fell into a pretty bad funk but was still kind of holding it together until COVID hit. I had to move back in with my parents and more or less completed my transformation into a NEET.

I tried to play my instrument again once or twice while I was home but pulling it out always made me really sad and anxious so that quickly came to an end. I didn't really have any back-up plans outside of music. With 2020 being the way it's been I also honestly started losing faith in humanity around the same time. I couldn't picture a particularly bright future for the planet and I sure as hell couldn't picture one for myself. I fell into a really deep depression.

I've been this way since March. I barely leave the house, I've lost pretty much all my friends, and my grades are hot garbage. I've bounced around from class to class but I just can't do it anymore. I can't do remote classes and more often than not end up missing lectures and assignments. 

I feel like if I try to take a quarter off to try to sort my shit out and not fail all my classes there's no way in hell they'd let me back in with my past grades as they are and I'd end up stuck in my small ass home-town for the foreseeable future, dooming myself to becoming a lonely NEET. But if I don't do that and just try to muscle my way through it then this semester is definitely going to crush my GPA  again. Maybe next semester might go better but assuming things stay as they are its more than likely that I'll shit the bed again end up right back where I started. It feels like every attempt I've made at self-improvement has been 2 steps forward 3 steps back. 

It's becoming really hard to fight the urge to just completely give up and either accept being a shut-in forever or finding a way to just end it all so I don't have to make any more choices. I just feel really stuck and don't know what the hell to do. The only things keeping me around at this point have been helping my aging parents with chores around the house and my cats. It's not the grandest purpose or the meaning of life but its kept me here so far. I feel like I'm running out of options and I'm scared.

I don’t want to be here anymore. I’m 25 , alone, at the beginning of uni. 
I fucked up my last assignment. Uni study has been my whole life during covid. 
I feel so depressed, I feel ashamed of who I am. My lack of motivation, feeling autistic about my sensory overloads when stressed. 
I wish I didn’t feel like death was the option but I’m tired of the pain of constantly failing through self sabotage.
I just don’t want to feel panic attacks anymore, reminded of all the times I’ve fucked up.
I don’t want to keep hoping for a better day.

Deep down I have loved life but I can’t get out of my mind how much I fucked up such a key assessment at a crucial time... I’ll never get a job or become anything and it feels like I just confirmed the prophecy of the bullies throughout my life.

1944,"I’m a 16m and I’m months behind in every single one of my online classes. I wanted to do normal school as it was an option but my parents made me do online even though I knew it wouldn’t work for me. Now I’m failing so badly I’m gonna have to retake 10th grade. I can’t do that because all my friends will move on to 11th grade. I can’t do the work. I don’t know why. My parents keep saying “you can do the work, you just don’t want to” and shit like that, but I seriously can’t. When I sit down to do it and look at it I just freak out and have a panic attack unless I close my laptop right away. So my options are either to fail 10th grade, which would make me want to kill myself, do the homework, which I can’t do, or kill myself now. But I can’t kill myself, there’s no method I have access to and if there was I wouldn’t be able to go through with it. So basically I’m stuck in an endless loop of misery where my parents hate me, I hate myself, and I hate living but there’s nothing I can do about it. On top of that, the one thing that kept me sane was Videogames, I would just play all day because it’s the only thing that made me happy. Now my parents took away the computer so all I do everyday is sit around waiting to die. I don’t even know why I’m posting this because nothing anyone says is gonna help, there’s nothing that will help. I’m on anti depressants and I don’t feel like they’re doing anything. Oh yeah, also people also always say to go out into nature and stuff to help with depression, but guess what? I have an extreme phobia of bugs to the point where I’ve been sleeping not in my room for over a year because I saw some ants and a spider in there.

They think he should have stayed for me, and that ""his timing was bad"" (a week before my birthday), as if any timing would be better.

School has a counsellor. Counsellor wrote me a safety plan. Showing it to everyone because well I don’t wanna die before the bucket list is finished. Aunt made it about her for some reason.

I’ve been pretty depressed recently, and haven’t been able to go to bed before 3 AM or do any school work, or even take an interest in my life. 

This time last year I was slowly getting over a serious drug addiction for good and getting my life back on track. To any outsider it seems like I’ve been doing well. I have a loving relationship, I fixed things with my parents, got my own place, and am finishing school. Even my friends who have seen me at my worst are really happy for me, and I can’t bring myself to disappoint them by telling them how broken I feel.

Quarantine has led me to self harm again, something I really haven’t done since high school. Even though I have proven to myself and my parents that I am a mature adult and capable of being independent, I feel overwhelmed by everything and I want it all to stop. I’ve been independent since I moved out at 18, but the 4 months I spend quarantining at my parent’s house made me feel so helpless. Not because of them, but because it just bridged this trench I dug between by old self and new self.

I haven’t like this in a really long time and I feel so helpless. I know I won’t act on it, but I want to so badly. My mind can’t stop thinking of the world ending and my family dying.

I'm in high school by the way. I go to school in person every other day because I like seeing people I know exist and smiling. That helps. But the times I'm at home, I procrastinate my work until late nights until I either get them done or finish them a week or two later. My parents say I'm lazy. Am I lazy? I don't think so. I do try to get things done, but I always do look back and think ""I could've done this earlier"" or ""I could've done this sooner"". Deadlines are a pain in the ass. I just think school is the root of all my problems, or at least online school is. Regular school is tolerable and at least I got to actually see friends and people, and follow an assigned schedule. Online school is just more whacky. Too much lack of sleep and procrastinating. Am I just blaming something else for my problems or am I the problem? I'm just tired. Tired of school. Tired of quarantine. Tired of all my problems.

Maybe I'm just overreacting or I need to find a schedule that fits me. All I do now is copy from other people and submit overdue assignments anyways. I've been told that high school is just the tip of the iceberg with stress and it'll only get harder afterwards, which is probably true, but I just want to be done with it now. School is dumb. If I wasn't doing school now I think I'll be happier or at least able to sleep better. I would wake up with a proper amount of hours, water my plants, and play some games or do some baking. Maybe do something new too. But now it's just tiring.

I'm also worried that it's also around this time that my seasonal sadness comes to punch me in the gut. (I don't wanna call it seasonal depression because I haven't been diagnosed nor do I think I have it, but I just get upset and tired around this time, so that's what I call it). I don't have a way to get through it except just waiting until the months go by.

2008,"I've realized the trend. Almost every November I hit a low. Usually end up in the psych ward. Or at least the emergency room. I realized this two years ago. And I've gotten so good at keeping quiet now. Suppressing everything. But it's still there. Pounding through my head. I take out the blender, and imagine turning it on with my head inside. Could I scramble up my brains with my hair? We brought a saw into the basement. But I think, if we ever set it up properly, I could cut my whole head off while he's away. The one thing keeping me here dialing through the days is a dog. A very broken dog I adopted. He hates that dog. I love that dog. Could that dog recover without me? Would he still be on a warm bed at night? That dog deserves everything. I deserve to be dead. Without me alive, I think this dog will also die. But then we could be together somewhere else maybe? I can't do that to him. The dog needs more time.
He likes to shoot guns in the backyard. I've warned him for years that I have issues and, given an easy enough chance, I'd hold that pistol to my head and hope I can hear my skull burst before I dive into the wonderful blissful blackness. He wants me to get my pistol permit. The plan is to get through just a few more years. Pay off debt. Get my permit. Assuming my last hospital stay is far enough in the past and won't be brought up. And then I have no guilt to be here. He'll be fine without me. He can take my car. Pay the bills. And I won't even have to use his gun. I'll have my own. I'll have legal permission to gush my own brains and blood into my backyard.
But every year feels like it's getting harder. I'm not even a human anymore. I'm a shell filled with regret. I want a do-over. And it would be so easy, to ask to learn how to shoot.

2012,"I apologize in advance for the ranting. Most may not be relevant to the situation at hand, but I have never been able to tell my story in its entirety and being able to write it down may prove cathartic.

I wanted to serve in the military not for the reasons that most people have, for patriotism or to pay for college or some such. I did it for simple reasons: I wanted to fly in an airplane as my job, and I wanted to be in an environment that promoted comradery. I am the forgotten youngest child of an absent father and mother who died too young, in a family torn apart by abuse and neglect. I was a confused little boy, fearful of a conservative father who would not accept him. From a young age I sought out a bond with a group I could call my family.

So, I enlisted right out of high school, and my feet touched the ground in basic training no later than a week after graduation. I had a blast, and met some of the best people I ever thought I would meet. My first attempt at suicide was shortly into my time into serving in the Air Force while I was still in job training, and I was at this time given the diagnosis of depression. I still do not know to this day what happened the night I attempted, beyond my roommate finding me. I still think about that night often, and the cascading effect it had on my life. I also think of the rage that filled me when the military psychologist asked me if I was just performing autoerotic-asphyxiation-gone-wrong when I tried to kill myself. Regardless, I was committed for a week in the psych ward.

My training for my job was multi-year long, and I certainly wasn't looking for more reasons to extend it. Due to a misplaced file pertaining to my security clearance, 18 months turned to 28 as I waited to go on to my second stage of training. However, things got better. I had a family finally, and I didn't feel alone. After the first attempt I tried, sincerely, to see the good in the world. It worked in those moments I lapsed and was thinking of suicide again. I went to therapy, and took my medications.

Upon arriving at my second training location, I had to receive a physical prior to moving on. At this physical it was revealed to me that, as I had attempted suicide, I was seen as a risk and would lose my job on an airplane I had been wanting to do. I was crushed, but fortunately my job had a version that was exactly the same but on the ground. I continued on, and by this point had been in the training environment for such a long time that I was becoming something of a legend to people, something not so much to fear but a spectacle nonetheless. Due to my significant mental health problems, I was barred from many locations my job could work so I waited at the training location for many years.

Nearly three and a half years into my service (last October) I got promoted to an NCO, something nigh unheard of in the training environment. It was around this time I began to experience physical issues with my brain and was given an SSRI by a neurologist for migraines. I began to feel on top of the world, with hundreds of people knowing who I was and seeing me as this cool, interesting person. In the span of three months, I went from a relative nobody to being a relative celebrity. I was bumping elbows with people 25 years my senior, and being paraded around as the golden child of my Squadron. Something I had desired my whole life was finally found: attention.

At the same time, something perhaps even more dangerous was happening, in that I was falling in love with someone for the first time, and they felt the same. (Side note: I met them long before the promotion, just didn't pursue prior) I went home with her for Christmas and found a family I could call my own that was even greater than the military in hers. Upon returning from Christmas, I got the news that I was finally getting to go start my job and leave, and it was only weeks away!

However, doubt began to cloud my mind, and demons felt like they were clawing their way out of my stomach. I feared leaving and losing my new relationship and new status. Would she forget me? Will I just be another person? These thoughts and more kept coming, and I felt myself crashing and spiraling. All the work, I could feel it coming undone, so I chose to look for help this time.

During this stay, my doctor told me I had an SSRI-induced manic episode most likely and the timing of everything was lined up in such a way that the effects of the pills were amplified by life events. I was diagnosed as bipolar II and told I would be spending multiple months in a partial hospitalization program. It just so happen that my girlfriend was also in the program, and so we ended up spending our whole day together talking about our problems.

Predictably, talking about our problems all day around each other lead to straining in our relationship. Also at this time it was revealed to me that I could not stay in the military any longer because bipolar requires lifelong medicinal treatment with lapse, an eliminating factor. I was subsequently medically retired from the military and decided to stay in town to try and salvage my relationship. This did not go to plan, and she found someone else. As a result of my retirement from the military and the circumstances that caused it, many of my superiors and peers saw me as a failure; I had spent over four years of my life here just to lose it all. I was alone, and it was a feeling all too familiar.

Now, to today...

I was unable to find work in the town I had settled, so had to return back to my hometown to my family. I am living with one of my brothers, and my presence is causing a strain in his marriage, which leads to arguments between him and me. I am likely going to be homeless within weeks.

I am transgender, and am out to just about everyone but my family. My oldest brother has threatened violence towards the LGBTQ community and minorities, and has proven on occasion that it is not just talk. My next oldest brother is a vagabond and, while a good person, is unreliable and unable to provide even for himself. My next older brother, well, I already explained. My father is worst of all, a man who could never accept me, especially now that I have returned as a failure. I cannot be myself for fear that grievous bodily harm will be all that I find.

I have been seeking therapy, but it doesn't help. Some weeks I stay up for days wandering the town aimlessly, others I sleep for half the day and don't leave my bed the other. Medicine only serves to make me feel worse and I have thought multiple times over the course of my time back home about killing myself. I am in that state now, trying to find a reason not to get in my car and finding something high enough to jump from.

These demons inside me, the imps on my shoulder, I feed them the spite and hatred for myself and the world that they so desperately crave. However, I struggle to find a reason not to when the world has defeated every possible beacon of hope I had. I lost my career, my relationships, my identity, and was forced to return to the last place I ever wanted to see. I don't know what to do, and I fear committing myself again because it was my voluntary commitment last time that destroyed the last vestiges of hope. I don't know who I am calling out for, and if anyone should rightly even answer, but please, help me.

This was supposed to be my senior year of high school, I was supposed to be excited for college and for the life ahead of me, but now everything feels like it's at a standstill.

I wonder if it would have saved me from all the embarrassment, and from this feeling that life just won't get better for me.

With these stories, I didn’t really have any limits at the time. No matter how fucked up or illegal. A few of the stories I came across were genuinely horrible with extremely young characters. This made me a little uncomfortable but didn’t stop me from reading and rereading them. I guess I thought because it was fictional and I was inserting myself into the roles of the child characters, it was fine to get off to them.

I want to make it clear that I didn’t seek out these stories for the age factor, and these were not the only stories I was reading. Many of the erotica stories I read had 18+ characters. I never sought out anything illegal, and whenever I came across a picture of a child, (sometimes I masturbated just for the feeling while going about other activities), I quickly scrolled past because I didn’t want to see that while getting off.

I guess I sort of lost interest in these stories and I haven’t read them in a long while now. Nor do I have any current desire to read them, because I don’t need them at all to get off. I totally forgot about all of this until one day a few months back I suddenly remembered in a low moment while my OCD (which I had had for years but didn’t realize at this point) was getting progressively worse, and felt disgusted from then on.

Ever since then I have been so angry at and feel sick with myself. I used to volunteer with kids during the same time period I was reading these stories and never made any connection. I want to be a mom one day. I know it wasn’t the age factor that attracted me to these stories, it was the other content in them, but I am still so angry, devastated, and horrified by it.

I also do a lot of private writing, and I never plan on publishing any of it so really anything goes with these stories (definitely some wish-fulfillment type stuff), and I have never ever written about harming or abusing children, so I cling on to that, trying to convince myself that this wasn’t some perverted desire and I will be okay.

But still. I am so angry with myself. Everyday. I fear (I’m sure a lot of you know how deeply rooted and terrifying this fear is) I’m some kind of pedo and I hate myself because of it. I struggle to enjoy things because I feel like I don’t deserve to for what I used to read. I feel like a piece of shit.

I guess this was just me getting this out there. For months I’ve been scrolling through reddit and other forums and have found many people in the same exact situation as me, but it doesn’t make me feel any better. I still feel like a freak. I am so remorseful and I guess this is my way of publicly apologizing for a private sin. If anyone has any advice that would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading.",Severely depressed over porn,1

2035,"2020 has been a rough year for a lot of people, including me. Ive never felt so lonely in my entire life. I’ve lost all my friend circles, all my trust, every little thing that used to make me happy only brings me pain and frustration. The only thing that’s been keeping me here is the hope that I’ll be able to bring a piece of that happiness back, but no matter what I do I just can’t make myself genuinely want to be here. I’ve reached out, but no cares or has taken me seriously. I’m so tired, it always feels like every breath is difficult now. I’m at my wits end here, I honestly have nothing else to lose.

So we hit it off, you know we both liked video games, tv, hated school, we had a lot of things in common, but like a month or two later he started swearing way more and being toxic, racist and homophobic. Not just like “your gay” but like fabbot and nibb hard r and I didn’t know how to react. My other friends thought it was funny, so I sorta tagged along and thought it was funny too I guess. And before I knew it, I started saying messed up shit like that also. About like half a year ago I learned a little more about this shit and I totally regretted befriending him. I would unfriend them, all of them, but first I’d be lonely, they are my only friends in real life, two, I could get easily blackmailed, they have messages and screen shots of me saying that stuff, if that stuff got leaked at my school I’m done for, seems there’s no other way out of this, only thing stopping me is my future and family, but my future is fucked if those messages get out.

2045,"(this is my first ever Reddit post... I can't think of another place to put it) 

I am going to start by giving a quick summery of my situation and the help I desperately need (my heart rendered in text right after) .
In a nutshell I am newly homeless but I have a car (I purchased it with the stimulus check as a cushion for the approaching impact with rock bottom). My only hope for carving a path to stability is keeping it for shelter and transportation to future jobs/interviews etc.. I have a cell phone atm and that's about it for my property aside from some clothes. I need $65 dollars to pay my car insurance (liability only thank god) or the car will end up getting towed/impounded, I will be arrested for driving without insurance (I live in Georgia.. No insurance is instant jail and impound) and I will be fined and put on probation.. I wont be able to pay the fines nor get the car out of impound which will result in violation of probation and I'll be made to serve the remaining probation in jail. I am speaking as though it is inevitible because it is. There are county, city and state police by the literal thousands here and they have these scanners on thier cars that automatically run every tag they pass so if my insurance lapses they will be alerted when the tag is ran (everything is integrated and online here). 

Second: I just discovered an app called Tasker/Task Rabbit that seems like it would change my life as I can do a myriad of odd jobs at my own pace and have a pretty broad range of skills but of COURSE they require a one time registration fee of $25-$30 dollars if memory serves... So just like pretty much everything else money is standing between me and hope for improvement. The bill I have is my cell phone @ $40 but I am willing to let it lapse and use Wifi from a fast food place to conduct taking jobs/payment etc if it means securing my insurance payment. Oh yeah, if it were to lapse and i managed to avoid getting towed/arrested I would have to come up with a down payment to start a new policy after the late payment period ends in 14 days.. Another impossibility...

 If someone out there is in a position to help me with any amount up to what I need (praying maybe several people will see this and send small amounts eventually meeting my need) it would be a miracle to me and I'd gladly return the money if income is found eventually. DEFCON 1 amount needed is $65. Next  in priority is $25-$30 to register Tasker account for jobs and last and optional is $40 for my phone bill but not imperative. My cashapp ID is $jwdoe. I have Paypal, Venmo and chime as well but have never really used them so I don't know the ID's off the top of my head.. If one of them is needed please LMK and I will figure out the relevant info. This is already a wall of text but i wanted to follow this with details regarding why I am where I am but I guess I'll just give some quick bullet points... Any elaboration desired will be provided upon request. 

-My immediate family is 98% dead. Father and older Brother passed when I was a teen. 
-Mother can barely keep things afloat on single income supporting dead beat stepđad that hates me and does everything possible to thwart contact between my mother and I (pretty sure he see's my opinions as threatening to his comfy situation). Aside from all that, she worked 3 jobs to finish raising me after dad passed so even if she had extra money I would hang myself before I took ultra deserved savings from her.

	-	At 21 I made around 25 dollars an hour as a production manager / press operator in the printing industry.... That is also the year I met / fell totally and irreparably in love with who would become my ex fiance. I worked up to 120 hours a few weeks (20 a day, 6 days a week. No joke) and always a least 80 to provide for my ""dream-girl"" and start building our life.

- All that time at work meant the ex had tons of unsupervised time alone with no job... which she used to start doing opiates and cheating on me to a degree I don' want to fully know. 

-I discovered the addiction by getting arrested on the way out of Wal-Mart. Unbeknownst to me she had concealed stuff in her large purse and was shoplifting said items to liquidate for drug money as her hab3bit was well beyond what she could spend with reasonable explanation from our money and screwing other men wasn't always profitable. Side note: In GA if you are with someone during the commission of a crime you are charged equally and have to prove your innocence in court.

-I ended up having to plea out to 4 years probation on felony shoplifting as a first offender because if i took it to trial and lost I could've gotten up to 10 years prison and my county bullies pleas by throwing the book at trial losers... My lawyer said it's your word vs loss prevention and my ex refused to admit i wasn't involved because (as i was learning) she is a succubus insane person that wanted me to be with her through whatever punishment came... 

-Obviously I left her, served probation... Officer with my case got fired, I was lost in the system for a couple years and once they found my file in the old officers desk they freaked out and violated me... spent the last 10 months in jail.

-Upon reentering society I began to have some pretty unbearable symptoms that turned out to be the Hepatitis C she gave me. Several years into it and I am more or less disabled as far daily labor is concerned. I am in constant and all encompassing exhaustion/pain/depression/loss of mental capacity (liver isn't filtering blood, toxins poison neurons and throw of brain chemistry causing debilitating depression).

-A cure has recently been discovered but since its a one time use product that illuminates its target market, it is around $80,000 and will remain there until the patent runs out nd generics can be sold. I can't afford to see a doctor to determine my genotype let alone pay that kind of money. Might as well be a million dollars. 

-Ŧhe icing on the cake is that my best friend turned out to be a master of the long con and stabbed me in the back / threw me under the bus. Turns out he too had an opiate addiction and once caught he blamed his continued use on me and told his wife / family I was essentially his dealer and was giving it to him for free (unemployed, stuck at home when caught) which is ludicrousness but it fit for his family because I had told them about what my ex had been doing in the shadows so he twisted that into the real truth being that I was also a junky and kept him hooked fir free while he was between jobs because i wanted his money when he found a new one... The heroin he was on averages a a low tolerance user between $50 and $100 a day... I had just had my entire world destroyed, my money stolen by my ex and my freedom taken from me all within a relatively short time.. there is no way I could fund someone else' drug habit.. My last close relationship was sacrificed to save face and cover up whatever he was really up to which must have been serious/bad because he gutted me without hesitation... 

-There are other traumatic events and horrific emotional events linked by bad luck but I already feel like this will never be read.... I am completely alone in this world.. My health and mind are failing and look forward to my last day on this planet with joy. I am not suicidal, I don't believe I get to choose when I die, but I am far beyond miserable and have lost everyone and everything essentially by being a good boyfriend / friend, working hard and being honest to my loved ones which would eventually be the weapons used to carve out my soul... Please for the love of god, if you can... Help me pay my car insurance... I can eat dumpster donuts behind dunkin D's when they throw out the stale and make new ones... I can't panhandle because i can't face bothering people like that and the Hep screwing with my mind has made me develop some social anxiety issues and most importantly, Its an arrest if observed by the police where i live... Please just one time in my life make this problem go away for the month... I can't take much more failure or sink much lower than the bottom... I am a man of faith and I believe that all of this has an ultimate purpose and I will carry my burdens as far as our creator requires .. But it sure would help me hold on during dark times if fate sees fit to send me some relief via one of you guys out there. Please forgive typos and punctuation etc... its 4 aṃ. And I'm on a phone in  car... Pṣ. I'm all but out of time.. i have a few days to make the payment.

You know what my first thought was? What is my dad going to say to me. Hes been on my ass the entire year about it. I feel judged by my fucking dad and sister and brother so much. I dont even like them all too much. My brother is a fucking fake and assumes what he thinks is always right. My sister is extremely judgy and talks shit. My mum actually seems to understand.

I just fell bleh. Like i don't fucking care about anything.  I didn't care about losing the job.  But about what everyone thinks of me.

2074,"I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else... The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over.

Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid.

2077,"Howdy y’all,

I’m 20 years old and live in the United States. I have a family who supports me, I have friends. I have a girlfriend. I feel so, so alone in ways I don’t know how to describe, and I’ve done so much that I regret that it hurts me every day, especially when I’m already down.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I’m looking to vent for a few different reasons. First, like the title said, my therapist quit. She had sustained an injury near the beginning of the pandemic, and took a break from her practice. I haven’t heard from her since, but I don’t blame her and I wish her well. Second, it feels like I’ve done a lot in my life that makes me feel I’m irredeemable as a person, and that’s part of why I’m so hesitant to talk to anyone about my problems deeply. Third, despite being surrounded by people who tell me they love me, I feel incredibly alone in my troubles. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the worst it has been since I was a young teenager. Around that age, I had unsuccessfully, and secretly, attempted suicide three or four times. I never really had assistance from my parents at the time, my mom had found out I was harming myself and promised to find me help, but I found out later my dad had forbid me from seeing a counselor or receiving medicine. I struggled with depression throughout my teen years, and eventually got on medication and started seeing a counselor on my own when I had turned 19. I’m still taking it, but I don’t think it’s working.

&amp;#x200B;

Those years I was not receiving any real help were the most difficult, until recently. And they were when I had done really, really awful things. Not anything I believe anyone remembers, or that had harmed anybody, but I remember them, and they harm me. I’m afraid to even detail it in this post out of fears that I’m being specific enough someone could identify me.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently, the last six months or so, are probably the most depressed I’ve been. I think about suicide often, and I have a plan, though the only thing preventing me at the moment is being afraid. I have a lot of people in my life that are fragile, and I know if they found out I had killed myself, they would blame themselves. I’ve fantasized about just disappearing for that reason, taking minimal belongings and just leaving, but I know my problem is me and there isn’t an escape from it. I feel trapped in this life. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of my dreams feel unachievable, because I’m either too stupid or lack the discipline or motivation. My life the past six months has been a constant cycle of slowly recovering, massively disappointing myself, and being at a lower rung than when I had started. I’m flunking important classes in school solely because I have studied at all, and I know it’ll be another disappointment once I finally admit it to my family and either fail or drop the classes. Not that they’d be upset with me, but failure is something I constantly fear.

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been taking a lot of these emotions out on my girlfriend. I don’t think I’m abusive, but I’ve been so depressed, and I know it weighs on her and she blames herself. Our sex life is dead and we argue every day. I feel like she secretly dislikes me.

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t talk to my friends or family as often as I should, and I know it strains my relationship with them. It feels like a burden. I’m afraid of ruining my relationships with them but also I don’t know if I care enough to maintain them.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess finally, I hate myself. I dislike my appearance, my attitude. I regret how I treat people often. I dislike the life I’m living even though it’s the one I’ve been working towards all this time. I constantly feel stressed and trapped within the same cycles. I’ve abandoned self improvement in a lot of ways. I spend most of my time sleeping or staying up all night trying to avoid thinking through drugs, sleep deprivation, and mindless activities like media. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am aware of all my faults and difficulties, and feel trapped by them. 

&amp;#x200B;

Rereading this, I realize how pathetic I sound, and how meaningless my issues are. It makes me feel weak, even though I know I couldn’t describe the entire scope of my depression in a reddit post.

2096,"Hello people, 

first of all, I'm 19 years old at the moment and I would just like to adress that even though I may not have all the experience in life, I've always tried everything that I could on figuring out what exactly my problems are, and why I feel how I feel. Now that I've adressed that, I just want to talk about why and how I got on the path that I am on right now. 

Well, as this year started I have just had a break up with my first real  love. I know it may sound dumb, since I was very unexperienced in relationships, but even after the time that has passed since then, I still believe I truly loved her. When I started doing things in real life again (partying, drugs &amp; mostly unhealthy ways of coping with these bad feelings) after isolating myself, I felt like I was just trying to justify my self pity, and I was telling myself that my feelings were not valid. Mostly because of the manipulative way she treated me, and always was telling me how I was just trying to hurt her, because I told her how I felt and how I dealt with the pain. And after this long period of being jobless, doing drugs almost every day, feeling the pain that I suppressed coming back, and the fear of generally ending as a dissappointment for my family and friends, I was snapping and just hurt myself very badly, as a new way of coping with everything going on. Over the course of the year, I also lost my Grandmother, who was like a second mother for me when I grew up. My Mom was also feeling hurt in a horrible, gruesome way after she passed, which resulted in her also hurting herself. As I found out, I was almost broke to my core, seeing the only person that was ALWAYS there for you hurting herself to cope with the same pain I've dealt with, it's truly the worst. Well, after we spoke about it and tried to figure everything out for ourselves, I actually fell back into the hole that I was in from the start, drugs self harm etc. To not make it too long for anyone to read, since you guys now know what my ways of coping with hurt and suffering are, I will not explain everything that has led up to the following situations I was in, but just tell you what happened straight up. One of my closest friends basically slept with my first crush I've had since the breakup, he knew about the crush too. I have been fired from my first side job since being jobless for almost 6 months, because I was telling my boss I wanted to be with my Mom after I found out my Grandma passed. I found another job that I could pursue, in which I never missed one single day, and was always putting in 100% of my power to make it all go flawless. This week, I took my first week of vacation, and basically was fired for that. They didn't tell me anything about the reason for firing me, even after I asked  them multiple times. I broke up with my girlfriend today, because I have realized that I'm not in love with her, but just with the way she made me feel. I told her exactly that, since she has always been good and honest to me, she deserved more than just a text, saying ""I'm breaking up"" or something like that. For me, personally, that pushed the last bit of motivation and happiness, and feeling of being safe out of me. So here I am, after a year of failing everything I possibly could, in every possible way I can, writing to strangers on the internet and hoping at least one person can relate, or is at least listening.

My dad died. That's when I knew this year is gonna suck. It was late February. He was amazing. Sweet and kind. Always fighting, he was depressed. Was in hospital multiple times, just like me. We are(were) really similar. 
No one knows why it happend. He just didn't wake up that one Saturday morning. 
My sister came into my room ""dad died"". 
I couldn't believe it. That was it. The worst moment in my life. My sister and me never had a great relationship, this is the first we hugged. I was 15, she was 17. 
Police were there because he died so young, only 61 years old. 
Following was the worst few days of my life. But i wasn't suicidal. Thank God it was normal grieve. Not depression. 
I went to school again. For a week. After that, covid came. i wasn't allowed to go out. Was trapped with no place to hide from my feelings. 

This was the last year at my school, i had to change to another school. So the summer came and so did my depression. 
I was in bed almost the whole day. 

School sucked for the first months. I don't find friends easily and I haven't found any new ones yet. 
I think that I'm annoying everyone.
I do have friends outside school tho. They are amazing and I wouldn't trade them for anything. But at school I'm lonely. Wishing to be dead. Every day. Crying myself to sleep. My depression got worse and worse. 

Also i was in pain. I didn't know what it was for a whole year. The worst physical pain I've ever been in 10/10.
I went to the doctor. They told me it could be gallstones.
Well there were stones.
I had surgery last week. Everything went fine. I'm recovering. 
I have to go back to school tomorrow.

I can't


I'm laying in bed hoping for something to come and end me. End it all.

I've been inpatient before, almost 4 years ago. It was one of the worst 3 months of my life. It traumatised me deeply. i can't get help. It scares me too much.

I can't tell anyone. My family lost my dad and my boyfriend wouldn't survive if I left him.

I wanna leave him. He is so sweet and caring, one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet. but he has a really short temper. And he hurt me so badly before. 
I'm still with  him even though he hurts me so bad. Probably because I need someone to talk to, a best friend, someone to hug and cuddle. 
I wanna die my hair get piercings and be my true self. But he doesn't like that kinda stuff.
I can't leave him. But i want to.

Killing me would solve that issue, well every issue.

I've always been smart. Had straight As and for the longest times this is all I identified myself with. 
School got harder. I'm not the best in my class anyone. 
I know it sounds stupid but all the stress...it's too much.

Am I just whiney and weak? 
I've been depressed my whole life and tried to kill myself multiple times...the first time I was 11 years old. 
I was bullied a lot. 
I self harmed for years. I've stopped almost 3 years ago and I'm proud of that. I've been strong for so long and I can't take it anymore. 
Honestly the only reason I'm still here because I'm scared, scared of the consequences if I fail again. 
Everyone would be so disappointed, my boyfriend would be mad. I promised him that I would tell him if anything was up. I can't tell him...
What if I fail? It will be much harder afterwards.

What can I do? My mom has high blood pressure and has medication against that. 
Can I overdose on that? Will it kill me? How much should I take? Where and when should I do it?

I'm still searching for little things that I wanna live for. Its hard to find them.

I feel guilty. I know that I would hurt my friends and family if I left. But do they actually care about me? I feel like everyone hates me and that I'm just a burden to everyone.
Despite that I told my friends how I'm currently feeling. They said I should get help and that they're there for me but I can't tell them the truth... I can't tell them how much I want to die. That i just don't know how. 
I can't leave them behind. One of my friends is depressed too. Her mother killed herself and she has to live with her abusive Aunt now. I can't do that to her. 
I can't do that to them.

Everyone would be so disappointed if i did it. And if I fail I'll have to see that.

Does anyone have small reasons to stay? Maybe advice? Maybe just something to say? 
I don't even know if people will read this. If you did, thank you for being here. 
Maybe this will be the last thing I post. 
Thank you reddit.",Why does everything have to be bad again??? (Vent),1
2099,"You could read a middle school health textbook about signs of a suicidal person and I'd probably hit them all.


Bad hygiene, isolation, flat affect and no visible emotions, apathy, self destructive habits, giving away possessions, changing my physical appearance, and talks about death or suicide.



I realized at work today (not because anyone said it, I just noticed) how many jokes I make even at work about death or suicide yet I've never had anyone say a word. Not coworkers but not close friends either. My whole sense of humor at this point is just death or suicide jokes I think, I talk about it *constantly.*




I show all the textbook signs of being actively suicidal yet nobody says a word. I understand if my coworkers don't because they don't know me that well, but you'd think one of my friends would. I only have a couple and they don't live near me but still.


They must know. They know I've felt this way before. I've been hospitalized for suicidal intent, told friends countless times I felt suicidal, etc. They have all the context they need to catch this when I'm talking so much about it that it is actually probably serious, but nobody ever says anything. Maybe they feel awkward but you'd think that would be less important than your friend dying. I guess not.",I realized how many suicide/death jokes I make and in general how many signs I show but nobody ever says a word about it,1
2100,"Seriously, is this shit ever going to end? I am a fucking disgusting 15 year old slut. A few days ago, I felt extreme shame because of my past mistakes, because of thoughts I had at that time, I literally imagined family members naked or having sex'n stuff. I felt like I was a disgusting person, which I obviously am and I constantly feel the need to tell people what I have done in the past (only the bad things), or I think they don't really know what kind of a person I am. I have two sisters, one is 10 and one 9. I didn't want to talk with them about sexual stuff, I really tried to be one of those good people. I felt like I shouldn't tell them, because they are young, but on the other side, I was just too obsessed over telling people about my past mistakes, I couldn't handle it. When I was around them, I would constantly have anxiety and feel shame, I would feel like someone with a big, dirty secret, so I told them both that I had sexual thoughts about family members in the past and that I feel bad about it. My 9 year old sister seemed a bit creeped out by it, but then she laughed and said that was just a long time ago. My other sister just said something like ""ew"" and didn't really looked like she wanted to talk about it, but then I also said something like ""even about my siblings"". I feel like I forced them into listening to my perverted shit, I also told my sister that I saw her with her hand in her panties one time, when she said she has never done something perverted, to make me feel better, which was really rude. All the time I tried to not get close to people because of my anxiety to harass someone was worth nothing, seriously, if I had known this was sexual harassment, I would have never done that. I feel like shit and disgusting. My sisters would probably say I didn't harass them and stuff, but I don't even know how to apologize, since I don't want to force them into any fucked up situation again...how am I going to live, if I found out that I harassed someone, I've already wanted to die, but now...I don't know who will love me now or even like me, how am I supposed to live if I have done something like this, I really deserve to die, no joke, you can just tell me that I am creepy and disgusting, I know that already and I just want do die for it, not because I want to play a victim, but because I am a terrible person and even tho my sisters act completely normal around me like always, I feel sorry for them. I don't know what I should do. I want to improve to a better person, but I know that my past will haunt me...","Hahaha, I really want to die now.",1
2101,"I know this is an incredibly embarrassingly stupid thing to get upset about, but I’m super mentally ill so... that’s probably why. Everything upsets me and makes me cry lately, lmao. Today was my 20th birthday and literally none of my “friends” bothered reaching out to me or taking two seconds to send me a message. How fucking pathetic is it that as a TWENTY YEAR OLD the only people in my life are my family, and even they’re only nice to me on special occasions? But if I were to die, everyone that doesn’t give two fucks about me now would suddenly be like “omg my bff 🥺 I loved her so much 😔🙏🏾“. And I guess it also upsets me because I make an effort to always reach out to people on their birthdays but none of those people felt it necessary to even acknowledge me today. It’s just really eye opening because I thought I had at least a couple of people who would reciprocate the same energy I have for them, but nobody did. Not a single person. Imagine being such a loser that literally nobody likes you except for a couple of your family members 💀 shout-out to my 80 year old Filipina co-worker for wishing me a happy birthday tho.

 I honestly think the only thing holding me back right now is the things I still have left to enjoy, although I doubt I will ever get there.

2109,"i never really dealt with depression until i moved away to college. it only grew worse and eventually was kicked out of school for low academic scholarship. i had no energy and motivation for anything. time has passed and after many prescription bottles of anti depressants, i seem to be doing fine at times. i’m okay most of the time, but sometimes i get into these bad depressive episodes where all i can think about
how i want to kill myself so bad. i’ve done the research and i know how i want to end my life, but i can never push myself to do it. i have a 4 year old brother that i adore and love so much as if he were my
child. the thought of killing myself, then my parents having to explain to him that he won’t see me ever again breaks my heart. he’s honestly the reason why i haven’t done it yet bc he always pops up in my head whenever i want to seriously kill myself. it’s great that i have someone that i care for so much, but they only make it harder for me to simply get rid of myself. idk what to do anymore. not sure what i’m trying to get to with this post. i’ve never shared these thoughts with anyone, so i guess just venting is my reasoning.",want to but can’t,1
2110,"18f. been struggling with mental health on and off for basically my entire life. anxiety, self-harm, potential autism, depressive episodes, borderline eating disorder behavior, whatever else you can think of. covid feels like a punch in the gut. starting college as a freshman in the middle of this pandemic has made my issues with making friends even harder than they've ever been. it's easy to pretend everything's fine but i just felt more and more trapped. self harm relapses, suicidal thoughts, anyways i ended up getting sent to the ER. whenever these doctors figure i'll make it through the night without killing myself, they don't even want to see me. nobody wants to listen to me beyond ""did you have a plan?"". nobody has noticed that i've been gone from campus for the past couple weeks.

for me, it's especially weird, because i'm either in a state where everything is fine, or i'm in a state where i want to SH/restrict/kms. sometimes i get worried that i'm just faking it because i go out of my way to look at triggering content sometimes. i get worried that i only feel this way because of a new medication and that i'm just causing people worry for no reason, even though the relapses started before the medication. sometimes i feel like some part of me wants to get worse, to get sent inpatient, to attempt suicide but end up surviving. i'm really not sure why. another part of me thinks i can just flip the switch and turn it off, and that i'm just romanticizing mental illness or something. 

my family seems to be running out of patience for me. they get mad at me for not wanting to get out of bed in the morning or do work or seem enthusiastic. i just don't want to do anything. i'm sick of the high expectations on me as someone who was great academically all the way until college. i don't want to put in the effort it takes to be a person, the bare minimum work it takes to exist. but i can't afford to let myself die. i don't want to die a terrible person, and hurt my family/my partner. my partner's love is one of the only good things for me right now and the chance to spend more time with them is something i don't want to give up. i'm also honestly terrified what happens after you die. as a lifelong atheist i believe it's probably nothing, but what if it's worse than life? idk how i feel it's like a constantly swinging pendulum. and my parents expect that i will be completely better after going through the outpatient therapy program i'm in. they probably won't let me go back to campus if i can't prove i'm ""perfect"". i don't blame them. i'm all they really have. it's a lot to be put on one person.

i feel like i don't have any more chances left to go backwards. if my mental health goes downhill from here i am scared i could lose the independence i have left. yet some part of me wants to get worse, and some part of me just wants to give up on being a person. sometimes i imagine different ways i could do it. i had a dream about suicide last night. i don't think i want to kill myself, but sometimes my mind thinks i do. 

constantly being treated as a crisis to evaluate gets exhausting. it's always ""do you think you'll be safe to go home tonight?"", which i understand of course, safety is priority and as someone who's had loved ones come close to suicide, i feel that nothing is more important than intervening to keep someone safe. it's just exhausting having all this in my head and not having anyone to tell it to most of the time. i'm afraid that my thoughts about methods will eventually cross the line where the people in my program will have to keep me inpatient. i'm not sure what i'll do then. if it's what i need, as scary as it is, i'm not entirely opposed to it...i'm more afraid about my parents and their perception of me if that were to happen. and of course i don't want to scare or trigger my partner in any way. it feels like i need to be strong for all of them, even when i feel like just laying down and disappearing, at least for a little while.

if you made it this far: thank you for listening to me. it's a relief to finally be heard. i hope you're proud of yourself - the fact that you're here to read this post shows that you've made it through everything so far and that takes a lot more strength than they'll give you credit for. just existing is more than enough, and i'm proud of you.",everything just feels wrong.,1
2111,"I feel like shit. I fucking hate this would and I just want to die. I can't wait for the sweet relief of death. What is the point of life if you cannot truly feel alive? And then we continue the same bullshit cycle over and over again, adding more links in the chain of human suffering, all for what? What is the real purpose? What is the point in it all? I did not ask to be here. I did not ask to be alive, to deal with the burden of life. Why couldn't we have chosen to not exist at all? I have no legacy, no meaning. Just a faceless person, a nobody.

Fuck society, they want nothing more but to bleed you dry until there is nothing left of you to give. I feel dead already, how do I feel alive? Why does life have to be this way? Why does no one demand an answer, why do we all pretend that it's okay for life to be this way and accept it so that out children can grow up and live the same shitty life that we once lived.

At this point even though im only 16F not even in my adult years life really doesn't appeal to me anymore. I get people telling me not to take medication and some even yelling at me to stop it.

I mean..Even the people who tell me life's worth way more then i think it is they can't explain why I've been hurt so many times over the years. 

I even had people believe im just faking this because im one of those ""attention whores"" people usually like me when im not venting.

I do feel sorry for myself. And y can’t I? It’s my fuckin life. I know know y ppl drink and smoke and do drugs. It’s cause they feel so much pain and love and emotions. That they just wanna suppress those things... even just for a lil while... it’s ok. Be selfish... Ik it’s not healthy but fuck it.

Maybe I don’t  deserve happiness. Maybe I’m supposed to be one of those crazy single aunts or creepy old uncles that no one really loves or likes but is there. Just waiting air and space. I hope I’m not. I hurt knowing that I’m no ones crush. I hurt knowing that no one wants me like that. I hurt not getting the respect Ik I deserve. I hurt getting stepped on and I want the hurt to end. I like the thought of strangling. I like the lightheadedness that comes with it. I’ve tried it b4 it feels good swallowing wat feels like gallons of air and feeling the blood rush back to my head. I’ve put many blades to my arms and wrists and legs. And it’s almost like art. Scar art. It does hurt and feels a lot different than when I try and strangle myself. But I do wanna know if it feels good wen the warm water from a tub rushes in and floods my bloodstream as my blood pours outta my body. It sounds bad... but I wanna ask someone wat it feels like. Good? Bad? Relaxing? Scary? Satisfying? Ik I sound like a real piece of shit and a real piece of work. But, I can be a real nice guy and romantic. I can switch it up pretty good. I wanna do all that corny romantic shit. I wanna put galaxy lights in my car and take long night cruises into the foothills. I wanna wake up next to u and not even think of ur messy hair or stinky breathe. Just the thought of u in my bed will be enough to wake me up. I wanna take walks in the beach as the sun sets. I wanna take trips to the mountains to take pics if u in the snow. I wanna show u off to my boys. I wanna take u home to my parents to show em how good I did wit this one. I wanna be able to kiss u wit my eyes closed and recognize the taste of ur lips. I wanna know ur curves like the back if my hand. I wanna give u chills even wen I put my hand on ur back. I want u to pick up with giddy in ur voice wen I call u. I want u to crave me. I wanna be all u want and need. Just let me be enough. I wonder if using a gun is too fast. Not enough cleanup... maybe just step in front of the fax bus. Or off the train tracks. Maybe some oxy or ecstasy. Lemme go out feelin good. Whatever it comes to.

2118,"It's too much. The stress, the shame, the loneliness, depression, anger, and hopelessness are all too much. I can't even function normally anymore. I've fallen way behind at work and will probably be fired soon, I've let friendships decay,  let hygiene fall totally by the wayside, etc. Drink close to every day now. Obviously it doesn't actually help but when you absolutely can't take reality what else can you do. Nothing else helps, and I know weed and alcohol long term make things worse too but in the moment it's better and that's all I can afford to think about. Tomorrow might as well be 50 years from now when you're living like this.



The emotions are overwhelming. I could be nominated for an Oscar for acting like I'm fine at work, putting on the chipper elated bullshit customer service voice for 9 hours and telling my coworkers I'm doing great. Then I get home or even just go to my car on my breaks and fucking lose it. I got home tonight and just threw my coat down on the floor, went to my room, screamed, hit the wall, hit my bed, screamed some more and cried.



Everyone just says ""Hold on you can do it :D"" but that's so fucking tonedeaf. You don't understand. The emotions are actually TOO much. I can't handle them, like at all. Someone saying ""Chin up"" doesn't change that at all, it just isolates me more and makes it all worse. I know people mean well but that really doesn't help. It just shows I actually AM out on this remote island like I think I am while every single person around me is on the mainland.





If someone was enduring extreme physical pain just about anyone would advocate giving them morphine or whatever it takes to take the pain away, they wouldn't say chin up sport you'll get through it.




I actually can't function in normal life anymore. This is a 50 ton weight on my back that just makes me wanna stay in bed 24 hours a day and whenever I don't have to work that's exactly what I do.


I can't can't can't can't fucking take it. I can't do my. Even shit like therapy and meds and whatever else (which already have never worked for me) take a LONG time to work if they ever do, and I need relief NOW. Again you wouldn't tell someone dealing with extreme physical pain ""oh in a year you might be fine, chill out.""




Nobody ever says anything actually constructive about this but they couldn't really anyway. Nobody is gonna actually take the pain away unless they're gonna give me some drugs or something in which case they're my hero.




It's a luxury to be able to consider long term consequences of everything you do. When you're suffering so much you can't even function or exist as a human then you do what you have to do. And when you don't expect yourself to live very long anyway, what are the long term consequences really anyway?","Immediately got home from work and just screamed, punched the wall and my bed, then cried and got drunk. Really can't do this anymore",1

growing up as a child I was molested by my brother from the time I was 5 till 11 at lease 3 times a week. I did not have anything friends growing up  so I always stayed to my self. I was put in to special ed classes as so at that point everything was more hard in my life.  Then in my 20s I lost the person that meant the world to me my girl friend at the time.  Then I got married a few lates and divorce. I am  now remarried no kids or anything. I lost my mom she meant the world to me a few years ago. She died one morn at home.  Now I am in my 30s and its getting worse.  I have life  of nothing but regrets. I dont even  know who I am just always been hiding. People make fun of me at work and say what a fuck up I am just like being in school again.  Once my mom left this earth has not been the same at all.

I feel truly awful for saying this but even when I was with my abusive, raping pos ex husband I wasn't feeling this hopeless... I have my own place, I'm lucky in that. But I would give anything to not have to deal with the social isolation. 

I've been thinking about suicide more and more since lockdown started, daily I go over different ways I could do it, the one thing holding me back is that there's no foolproof way to do it. 

I keep reading studies on how isolation can increase risk of heart failure, and given the physical pain I'm in I get a little hopeful that I'll just slip away and the people I care about can get on with their lives.

In total, i have about 6 friends. I call them friends but they probably don't call me their friend. Some are just straight up like ""i hate you"" and other ones just act like they're annoyed around me. I mean I guess it's fair, after all i am clingy and constantly needing of attention. Considering i have 6 friends that hate me, i naturally have nobody to go to when I need to vent. This is one of the reasons I bottle up my emotions, the other reason being mental abuse from parents in my early ages but that's not important.

As comes with bottled up emotions, i have reached a point where I can't cry anymore. There's no way for me to express all my sadness and anger. That's not all. I've also been diagnosed with ADHD, which plays some part in me having terrible anxiety and my large forgetfulness. Combine that with school and that's already a trainwreck.

but wait, there's more. Recently I've been questioning myself way more than I'd like, about things like my gender and sexuality. As of lately I've been starting to think I'm trans, which is putting lots of pressure and making me super anxious. I can barely open my mouth to speak without wanting to puke.

My parents have also stopped taking me to my therapist, and i don't know why. I think it's because we don't have very much money right now.

that's it. There's much more i don't feel like typing that i might add into another post later on.",only a few years left 🙂👍,1

&amp;#x200B;

So basicly about 10 months ago now i was diagnosed with 'winter depression' and i didnt have it too bad, i had my girlfriend who i stayed with most of the time during the corona lockdown but that also resorted in our relationship falling apart and since then i feel like it just keeps going down hill, like theyre rarely any positives i can find in my day.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the summer i was doing ok and i stopped going to my therapist for my depression because she deemed it over, me and my ex also started talking more and become a bit like besties i guess you could say which was really nice until she would just randomly stop talking to me completly for weeks and it was a bit painful because i saw her as a very good friend and didnt understand why.

&amp;#x200B;

Then school starts again and my roommate who was also one of my best mates decides to just dip on me and move in with some other guy and cut the contact completly, that hurt me quite a bit and i confided in my ex because that was the stuff we used to talk about and make sure we were both happy, fast forward a bit and my ex's granddad dies which is devastating for her and i try and comfort her to the best of my ability which ends in us hooking up - which was nice even tho neither of us wanted to get back together.

&amp;#x200B;

And now we are in the present, my ex suddenly stopped talking to me completly and does not want anything to do with me which first came as a bit of a shock and it then destroyed to me, to me she was the only person i had left i could completly open op to. These past 2 months feel like they have just been pain on pain the whole time like everyday something bad happens to me and i know this seems like i am just looking at all the negatives but i am usually an optimist which is the wierdest thing about it all but i just cant see anything good in my life right now it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

People repetetly just start to take distance from me and at first i though it was because of myself because i became a bit sut in because i was sad but i try my best to keep in contact with people and come to events or friend/group hangouts.. i dont know if i am just becoming un interesting or what it is but lately ive had a lot of suicidal thoughts.. like how i wanted to to do it as in which way would be the quickest and least painful and ive thought about writing a suicide note about me apologiesing to my family for what i had just done.

&amp;#x200B;

Just yesterday i was talking to one of my good mates about some of this stuff and that i was feeling down and that i was sad about having lost my ex as a friend.. I then find out they have been talking a lot for like the past month which is fine because in reality it is none of my business but i was drunk so i starting asking about if he knew why she suddenly just stopped talking to me which he didnt. Next day i wake up to a text from my ex which is a first in 6 weeks saying ""Why were you asking so much about me"" and to be fair i dont really care that she knows its more the fact that the time i open op again which i havent done in quite awhile because i felt insecure about the whole thing it just becomes gossip... I dont know who i can talk to about this so i am posting it here.

&amp;#x200B;

I have had trouble sleeping the last 2 weeks because i just lie there and think and eventually cry and then the next morning i feel tired as hell but ive started exercising before going to bed and for some reason it helps..

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for bad grammer.

My only hope in feeling any different emotionally are antidepressants. I tried a few antidepressants recently and only one had an effect on me, it accomplished making me completely emotionally numb. I really enjoyed this for the first week since I finally had a break from feeling everything at once, but I eventually started hating the feeling since it is the polar opposite of what i've felt my entire life.

2163,"I feel so bad, so fucking bad.

In the last 10 years I have tried everything for my chronic depression. Ive tried meds, therapy, excerise, workbooks, weird diets, even essential oils. Nothing. 

This last year has been particularly hard. Ive been hospitalized 3x for suicidal idealation and schzio shit. Attention, story short, I need to stop lying to myself. I did it because I am starved for attention.

 I now am stuck doing ect, I hate it. It helped for a little bit, amazing! but then the Dr switched it to mainence, less and less, and it must not have been done properly because the depression just came back. But despite how much I hate doing it, I told the Dr, I would do whatever she suggested and follow whatever regime she thought would be beneficial. I am not bitching out on ect because it scares me so much.

If you read my post history, I posted here before because I need attention. My parents are good people, and gave me the perfect childhood. I have a great husband. But here I am, its not enough, I want to jump in front of train that runs less than a mile from my front door. I hear it all night tooting, or whatever noise you call the noise a train make. But I just want the attention. How horrible am I to manipulate people with suicide?

Thats the thing about suicide. Like there is an acceptable amount of time to be troubled by it, some unknown number. You can only ask for help some magical amount of time for it to be legitaminite. Once you surpass those numbers, you're the attention whore. You're a horrible person. Everyone is tried. Don't you know suicide is like a real issue? other people have it real hard. Some people don't have a home and you have the nerve to sit on a fancy ass mattress, with a belly full of Mexican restaurant food, in a heated home and want to jump in front the train. Wow.

I'm ungrateful. There is no more talking to my husband, confiding in my mother, going to a hospital, or new hopeful med to take. At this point, it's all for attention. So shut up while you're ahead. Nothing left to do, everyone is done and you're still plague by these horrible overwhelming thoughts. The end.","I just want attention, I'm an attention whore.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I hate working, I hate talking to people face to face and on the phone, I hate going into the gross building everyday, I hate these stupid boomer coworkers who refuse to wear masks and insist on inviting me over to thier house to socialize and then get mad when I remind them there's a pandemic and totals in our state are skyrocketing?? But then I could catch covid, and if it was quick about killing me I wouldn't mind too much. I just dont want to be miserable in a hospital 45 days prior to dying. just nice and quick.

On the other hand, working is good for me, it keeps me from dwelling on my problems, it gives me money so I can not be homeless. 

On the other other hand, money doesn't fix pain and now I can barely talk to anyone. I'm one of my few friends who isn't suffering because of covid. I don't have anything to say to them, because they have all these real problems with school and evil landlady, etc, I'm just collecting paychecks as usual. I guess normally I could distract myself with something to buy or do but not happening in these times. (unsaid part, wanting to also die like usual)

I am also now seeing I am horribly mismatched to my current boyfriend. He's a normal, likes to spend time with family kinda guy. I didn't really have a good family growing up so I've always substituted my boyfriends families. Well this time it isn't working out, he's really close to his family and I don't like spending time with them. They are all normal boring people who enjoy doing normal boring people things like watch talk shows and have BBQ cookouts and go to church. Usually I've meshed more with the boyfriend's family but this time it's not working. I don't talk about sports, I don't watch talk shows, I don't fuck with makeup, I like to talk about drugs and music and inappropriate adult things. And informed political discussion (I don't teach or explain you either understand or we're not discussing the topic) I guess I got really really lucky with the first boyfriend's family and I never will again. Most old people who raised kids don't enjoy those topics.

Well this mofo and all his damn family probably gonna give me covid too. they spend time like fucking four times a week since no one is working due to covid.

we are getting an apartment together which is truthfully kinda stupid, I should probably move out and  get my own place, but I was crying the other day because I know this isn't going to solve our problems. But dude will not listen. I already see that I'm gonna end up throwing him out (he has a home to move back to, I do not)  and I'll just be in the place myself, which I'm already dreaming about.

Because I am a profoundly stupid person, I only recently became afraid of covid (I've been watching this thing since January, and yet it was only in October did I start to actually feel anxious)  and I recently became aware of the fact that I don't love my boyfriend, I actually fell in love with someone else eight years ago and I've been pushing those feelings aside, for 8 FUCKING YEARS  and of course they felt the same 8 FUCKING YEARS AGO and blowing me off now (of course lol)  I'm just gonna assume they moved on, have a wife, have a good job, all those things that wouldn't have been possible for them if they had me instead. 

I'm never going to find someone else who loves me, I had it but ignored it like a dumbass because I was trying to salvage some other dead relationship. Now I have all this money I could be showering on the person I love but instead my wages are sitting around, collecting dust. When I messaged them, it was juts a friendly hey what's up. I have a fantasy that they will respond like 5 months later, and I'll be dying of covid and I'm just gonna say hey just trying to get in contact with you because I need someone as a beneficiary, all I need is your physical location and you'll have like $20 grand once the estate settles after I die. It's crazy I kind of wish this would happen so I could give them the money, because god knows I'm not doing anything with it. I know they could put it to better use they are smart and probably need it.

But no, I'll never hear back. Not even for closure. It's a nice day, sun is out. My boyfriend got a shotgun, he left to go hang out with his family and I feel like taking it, going for a hike, and shooting myself in a park. (if I shoot myself here in this house me and the rest of the residents be evicted if I survive, plus mess for others to clean up) I'll just leave instructions for the money to be given to a political cause instead of the unrequited love, because how miserable of a surprise that would be if he gets a lawyer call telling him the girl he fucked 8 years ago shot herself but left you $20 grand!

2374,"The title basically says it all, but I was driving to the store today. On my way, I pulled out into traffic and completely mis-judged how close an oncoming car was. It wasn’t dangerous or anything, but the car was definitely close enough that the person had to slow down a lot because of my stupid move. 

They honked, flicked me off, etc. We ended up pulling into the same parking lot I was going to. To make matters worse, we both got out of our cars at pretty much exactly the same time. The guy came up to me and wasn’t yelling, but was obviously annoyed and started telling me how I cut him off and how I’m a fucking idiot. 

To be fair, he was right. I didn’t mean to cut him off, but I definitely did. 

I said that I was super sorry and that I mis-judged traffic big time. I told him that I hate it when people cut me off in traffic and that I was definitely wrong. 

He looked kind of shocked. Then, he said, “Dude, I’m sorry I was being a dick.” And, no joke. The dude went in to hug me. We did that awkward stranger hug (with our masks on, obviously) and he told me to have an awesome day. We went our separate ways and that was it.

Back to the lambs, you probably overheard the guy at the front tell me that my front tire was about to burst and it needed replacing. Then he said that the fourth one was well on the way but I could probably get away with not replacing it right away.  took out my wallet and counted what I had but I knew I’d have to do it anyway. I said go for the third one and left the lobby to call my clinic about getting coupons for my asthma medication due to my dad being laid off and getting kicked off insurance. I’d have just enough after the tire and oil change to get a very generic rescue inhaler. I walked back in again stressing about my fourth tire and you’d left already, the guy at the front called me up again and my heart sank. What was it this time? I don’t have anymore money!

2398,"At least , that's what they thought it was. I had written a poem that night. It was called: 'My sun won't ever shine again.' It had a real fancy alliteration in Dutch. 

The next morning, I woke up to my mom and dad crying. They'd found the poem on my desk.

I didn't mean for it to be a suicide note. But when I saw them crying, it really hit me something was wrong. That's when I learned that it is, in fact, not normal to be suicidal.

I'm 18 now, and I just unlocked this memory. And I feel so bad for that little girl. I have so much empathy for her. She should've never ever felt that way. She did not deserve to be treated the way she was treated. Somebody should have protected her. It was not her fault.

She was a wonderful, sweet, kind, smart, bubbly little kid. I wish somebody had told her.

Sadly no one did.

2399,"I'm a guy and I'm straight, but that's not important - or at least it shouldn't. I dress normally all the time, usually plain shirts, band shirts, and jeans or shorts - basic, always casual. I don't hate the way I dress, but sometimes I feel like men's clothes are so bland and I wish I could change sometimes. I fancy skirts and thigh high socks, but they're labeled as women's clothing and I can understand that from a certain point of view and yet I wonder why I can't rock that combination myself. I've been raised outside that mentality that dictates what boys or girls should wear, what toys they should have and whatnot. Clothes are clothes, I think as long as someone enjoys what they're wearing they shouldn't really have to explain themselves. I know that clothes in a certain way have to do something with gender - after all men and women are built differently - but I think some stuff could go well for everyone despite their gender. I talked to a friend about this and their reaction was calling me gay and that's where the conversation ended. I know clothes don't change my sexuality, I really think it is funny to see people get mad when you say you're curious to try something new and their brain just can't process the fact that you can act beyond their logic of how things work. I'll probably save some money and buy socks and a nice skirt myself, maybe a shirt as well, and see if I like it or not.

The word ""please"" doesn't get enough credit for showing care, concern, or even just feeling wanted. 

It's a huge leap from ""take care of yourself"" to ""please take care of yourself."" 

""Know that I love you"" vs. ""please know I love you"" is such a stark contrast. Maybe it's just to me.

But saying ""please get home safe"" shows that someone actually is there. Someone cares, versus when it's just ""get home safe."" 

It's also how people are taught to use it, it shows consideration.

It's one of those whimsies, or small things, that can just brighten things up.

I watched an old video of a memory I can’t even recollect, and it gripped me. I suppose I’m feeling sorry for myself, in a way, but primarily for this child’s future. Soon this child’s parents will split, his mother will date an awful, abusive man, his father holding the camera will later tell him that the child is a product of an affair with his brother (which was wildly untrue), years of self hatred, and so many trials and tribulations that never seem to cease. But this is cherry-picking some of the the worst things I’d prefer to never experience. 

I think I’m mainly sad because these documented snapshots of time show that you once lived in Disneyland. You lived in that conceptual place that never was but is so well fabricated.

Life is impartial, and it has the potential to be sweet or awful.

In my last two years of HS, I became friends with certain guys and since my female friends had never actually seen me interact with me they constantly teased me whenever I as much as spoke to a guy.

2428,"So some of you may know that I am one who loves being different and trying new things as I continue to try to build a fulfilling life. One of my longer experiments has been using a flip phone for the past year.

It has been amazing to do this. I have felt less stress and fatigued from the feeling of always being connected. Before switching I was averaging about 6 hours a day on my smartphone( I spend about 30 minutes a day on my flip phone). I also had a huge drop in impulsive spending as I had 6 hours less of adds. My relationships also became more fulfilling as I would actually call people because the T9 was rough to get used to. Overall it was a great change.

This past weekend though I was canoeing down a river a few days after major storms and the river was a lot rougher than anticipated and I ended up being thrown from the canoe. I made it to shore and made a fire to warm up I tried to make a phone call but found that my flip phone would not turn on after being submerged for about 20 minutes. 

I originally thought about buying another flip phone but after some careful thought I am deciding to get a smartphone. The first major reason is I want something water proof for all my outdoor adventure. I think being able to track my river adventures and exercising in wet conditions and have those metrics will be very useful. I also was in a car accident a month ago and the fact I had to drive home in my badly damaged vehicle to file a claim was a bit stressful. I think the convenience and security of having a smartphone will make it worth it.

In getting a smartphone though I really want to retain some of the amazing experiences I had with a flip phone. I am thinking that I can put it in do not disturb for 22 hours a day and only check it in the morning and evening for short periods of time. I am also thinking of going all out and getting a fitness tracker/ smart watch as well to reduce the times I need to pull it out to check the time and to see only important notifications( I work for a 24/7 fire and water restoration company so need some notifications to come through).

I've never had a genuine friend in my life, but last December I met this guy and we became friends, but the best thing is that we had a lot in common, almost everything. I'm a girl with weird taste in popular culture and I live in a third world country, so finding someone who has similar taste to me is almost impossible and I was so excited to find him and he seem like he was too, he included me in his future plans in life and we used to talk every day. I genuinely cared for this person like a never did to someone in such a small amount of time.

A moth ago I started to feel a weird vibe from him, he didn't text me or tried to make conversation with me. The last straw was when I rushed to tell him that my mom was being abusing to me and he brushed past it like he didn't care and text me next morning to tell me that his girl friend needed help with something and he forgot about me. I was sad so I told him that hurt me and he apologized but nothing has been the same, we've talked about it three times now but nothing changes.

Three weeks ago we stopped talking everyday and I die every time I see him online and he doesn't talk to me because I have no one else in my life.

2438,"So for some context, I usually get sleepy earlier than my boyfriend does. He’s a gamer and a night owl, and we have the PC in our bedroom. He likes me to hang out where he is even if he’s playing (says he finds my presence comforting). I get sleepy, fall asleep, but then wake up at least once because of the screen. This is obviously not quality sleep and it leaves me quite grumpy and unable to fall back asleep, so I told him I’ll go to sleep in the other room if I get sleepy, period (we’ve had issues with this before). 

So when I fall asleep somewhere else and he’s already turned off the PC, he’ll wake me up with his sweetest and most soothing voice as to not upset me, to take me back to our bedroom, hugging me by the waist. He won’t even let me take back the pillow and sheets, he does it for me. And the way he does this is just so tender I feel happy, and have no issues falling back asleep. 

But last night he went the extra mile. 
“Honey... my love... let’s go to sleep, come on...” 
I, as a bit of a reflex, grab the pillow half asleep and he says “No no, leave it there, honey. Come, put your arms around my neck.” So I did... and he proceeded to pick me up in his arms! It took me by surprise, but I felt so pampered and warm it makes me want to cry remembering it. ❤️

He put me in our bed carefully and brought back the sheets and pillow. I reached for his face to caress and told him I love him, and he said “Honey, don’t stay awake for too long... go back to sleep okay? I love you too.” And he kissed my cheek before we both rolled over and fell into deep sleep.

Moral of the story: it’s the little things like this, gentleness and warmth, that keep a relationship alive.

I mean absolutely no disrespect and I'm sorry if I word something poorly and it comes across as insensitive.

Ok, so here goes...

Handshakes have never made sense to me, and I doubt they ever will. I've never understood people's obsession with touching each other the whole time. ""Hello stranger, who I've never met before and know nothing about. Allow me to hold your hand, but it's not uncanny because we shall move our hands up and down vertically a few times."" It's always struck me as bizarre and rather creepy. 

I've also never understood people's fixation with having to stand really close to one another. In my mind 6 feet is a bare minimum, there only reason I can imagine to stand closer is for a kiss or a fight, both of which would land me in trouble if I did it to the person behind me in the queue. We're not sardines in a tin, so why do people seem desperate to emulate that?

Gatherings exist as this weird amorphous blob of ""hey what now?"" in my mind. It's utterly incomprehensible. Someone gets married, let's get a bunch of people to sit close together in an room. Someone dies, let's get a bunch of people to sit close together in an room. Not to mention willingly attending something like a music concert. The very idea makes my brain nope out.

I shake hands because I've learned that that's what people expect. I allow people into my personal space because that's the way the word is orchestrated. I attend gatherings because I've learned that refusing causes more problems than just braving it. 

I'm 30 years old and for 29 of them I've felt like I'm in a play but nobody has given me a script.

Enter 2020, the year the creepy handshake dies, the year people respect personal space, the year where I don't have to dread being invited to the next pointless get together. 

For the very first time in my life I feel like the world finally makes sense. Now with the news of the various vaccines I hear people getting excited for the world to go ""back to normal"", whatever that means.

But because the big C happened, our school is on lockdown-- actually, the whole country.

2486,"This child, boy, man, was until recently one of my best friends, and my ex boyfriend. I've known him for almost ten years. We met at highschool. He had feelings for me then. We got distant for a year and our real friendship began after that year. 

I loved his company with every piece of my heart. We didn't mind he had a crush on me so we got along. In fact I started to like him. We tried something but I wasn't that comfortable. Until I fell deeply in love with him, when we were starting to become adults.

We dated, I think two years. I didn't keep the count. I enjoyed our union as much as I suffered it. I expected too much from him. I loved him as he was but there were some things I idealized, so I got hurt a million times. I think it was the toughest period of my life. Nothing that tragic happened, but I developed depression. I was in desperate need of love. A kind of love I was not receiving and was looking outside instead of inside.

I tried to start an open relationship with him like 5 different times because being closed made me so needy to the point it was mostly pain. But his response always was ""closed or nothing"".

When I was on treatment we broke up because I left him. It was awful. I felt left out and deeply alone so I did my best to hurt him back and broke everything on purpose to keep him apart. Then I run back to him because my ideals of him were still stupidly strong. He accepted me back. We forgive each other and ourselves, at least me. 

Getting back together was magical and even better than the first time. But it all slowly started to break. So I realized I was not in love with him anymore. And gratefully, he was neither. So the burden of hurting him didn't exist. He also wanted to break up.

We didn't stop being friends. My love for his actual person was big enough to keep him in my life. I enjoy his company, his sense of humor, the way he deals with life, etc. But I noticed he was idealizing me even more than I did with him. He never really liked my personality. We almost never could talk about things. He was never supportive unless I told him he had to be. I just wanted the kind of love that makes you move a mountain. I didn't move him, but I'm not sure if anything does. And he always had something to say about how I act or think in a pretty derogatory way.

I thought it was because we were too much close he was like that with me. But these last months he left it clear. It wasn't the closeness of our romantic relationship that made us non-functional. I think he has a big ego and gets tired of people easily thinking everyone is stupid. Last time we talked he was mean to me with no necessity and it hurt because I love him so much and I had to recognize it was enough and I had to end it.

It doesn't matter how much I love him, he doesn't like me, or maybe there's something else inside him that pushes him away from me. I don't really know, and I'm tired of thinking about it. And I don't think it's worth to keep fighting for someone that does not love you back and keeps pointing in a mean way things about you that are harmless. 

It might sound stupid, but I was just making up conversation about things I like and something I know he likes too. He straight up told me: don't you ever talk about anything else? Not the first time he makes clear he doesn't like listening to what I think or say. And I should told him it hurt me, but before I could say it he said ""I don't say it in a mean way, on the contrary"" but I don't believe him because his behavior shows me the truth. He doesn't like me. And if it was anyone else I would gladly said well fuck you then. But I couldn't because I love him and I've always accepted abusive manners towards me from people I trust and care about. 

I've always believed love is worth the punch. And sometimes it is, if it's consented, if there's confidence, if there's sincerity.

It has been more than a month that we stopped talking. Usually I forgive his behavior, convince myself that I'm overreacting, find an excuse, talk to him again and the same thing happens. I get hurt unnecessarily. And I don't wanna go back anymore.

But it hurts how much I miss him, how much I want to talk to him, and I have to find the strength in me to kill my need of him and accept he does not love me like I do. And it hurts. Because I loved my best friend and we've been together through a lot of good and bad shit. But I have to do this for myself. Unless one day he realizes he loves me too and shows it to me. But I wish when that time comes I'm over him. Because I believe he does deserve my friendship anymore. 

All I wanna do is hold him, kiss his head and tell him I'll always love him deeply, deeply. I wish he knew how much I love him. I want to cry since I made the decision to leave but I can't. That's why I wrote this. I wanted to cry. I wanna cry because I know when I cry my decision will be a fact and not just a desire. When I cry I'll really know it's over.

Some of my best memories have been with them and this one group in particular, and they've been there for me during my lowest lows as well, so they really mean a lot to me. 

So it follows that I'm really scared that they're not going to want to keep in touch with me - most of them are going to be living together and so I feel like they'll get super close over the next year while I'll only occasionally be able to drive up and see them. Wouldn't this mean that they'll stop talking to me as much? I don't want to be that annoying former friend who is always instigating the conversation so I'll try wait for them to message me first for a bit, but what if they just don't?

I'm also terrified at the prospect of hurting my girlfriend - she's moving back home to the same area as me but we've decided to break up at the end of the year because we'll be too far apart to make the most of our time, and we'll both be busy with our respective universities. On top of that, i don't want to burden her with my mental health issues because last time she caught me in the middle of a panic attack she almost broke down herself, so I think breaking up is probably the best thing going forward.

2498,"A storm washes over a small town. A kind of town which is picturesque, whose pictures tell you stories of memories and easy days. 

It blows over many sheds, poles and trees. But one particular tree is uprooted which seems very odd. Its odd because it was a large tree, strong with deep roots. If you looked at it you wouldn't guess it could be uprooted.

But it did. Lying across the green lawn in the open ground which had enjoyed its large shadow for years, now bearing its weight. The roots lay bare, gawking at the passerbys. Exposing the part which wasnt meant for the public eye. 

The only difficult question is to decide who lost the most. The roots which lost its dignity or the soil which lost its roof. 

A tin shed which had blown near the tree lay on the roadside, wondering. 

""How?""

Perhpas more pertinent question was, why?

And yet, the shed mused to himself

""Is it wrong to hold on too strong?""

""Is it wrong to give it your all?""

The dust was the sole admirer and the uncaring sun burned hot. The sermon moved on.

""Why you must dig so deep, tree my friend? If only you were more malleable, more welcoming of change you would not lay there.""

A car stopped near the shed, a door opened and shut.

The tin shed listened hard for he could not look who it was walking towards it.

2507,"Something I've noticed the last few months (and days especially), is the level of hesitancy among my friends or people I know with regards to vaccines. Specifically the potential COVID-19 vaccine(s).

I wouldn't consider any of these people anti-vax, nor would they consider themselves anti-vax. But it sjust interesting to me how scepticism can creep its way into your mindset without you knowing. People will justify it too by saying things like ""oh I'll wait a few months to get it in case there's any side effects."" Like a few months will make any difference when the drug has already gone through tests and trials.

I don't know. It's just scary to me that something so important as a vaccine during a global pandemic can induce such scepticism and fear in people who normally seem so level-headed. 

Personally, I don't care. I will get a vaccine as soon as I can. It's not like the vaccine is a new games console that releases with not that many games or has a bug that isn't fixed for a few months.

2509,"Wasn't sure whether to post this here or not, but I figured I'd just give it a go since I got stuff on my mind. I'm a 19 year old guy, graduated out of highschool recently, pretty easily too since I had no exams, and I'm taking a gap year until next September, where I'll hopefully be on my way to Uni.

For a long ass time, I really struggled to find what I wanted to study and do, and only recently chose acting. And I thought it woulda helped, but a lot of the time I just feel so overwhelmed by the stuff to do. Look into unis, think about price, even though my dad is helping, think about where to live, and think about careers. Especially for acting, it's hard as fuck, and you've gotta work so hard to get noticed.

And now I've got a 3 month job, it's great, pays well for someone who's not studying, but uni application periods are kind of zooming in on me and I feel like I haven't made any progress. So many more places to look into, applications to send, and just yesterday I started having doubts about my studies and if acting was really my thing. 

Frankly, I have no way of knowing. I've never done any acting, I just passionately love movies and love the idea of playing different characters, but I remember that my first choice was game design studies, which also sounds pretty cool, but is also insanely hard. I just wish someone could give me a clear answer on what to do and that I had a straightforward path, but that's unrealistic lol

My dad keeps telling me that while careers are important, I should focus on doing what I'm passionate about and being happy, which is true, and I do think he's right, but how can I not worry about my future and my job? I need to, right? I can't really be happy if I can't have a place to live, pay for my stuff, and all that. I dunno, it's just a lot. 

He also tells me that even if I study acting now, life might take me somewhere else like it did for him. And that might happen, who knows. I just can't help but always worry and get kinda freaked out when I think about Uni. I either start getting scared about my future, or if I'm making the right choice. My goal was to take acting classes before December (which is when I need to apply for UK unis), to see if I liked it, but I can't now because of my job.

I'm sure it's gonna be okay, but there's always a nagging thought telling me it might not be. Shit, what if I end up homeless or something? What if I end up never succeeding with my career, whatever that may be, and end up having to work jobs I don't love for most of the time? Just stuff like that that makes me really anxious, and my brain just gets overloaded with stuff.

I learnt a lot of life lessons, have 2 jobs (now 1 cause I finished with the one) so that brings me to making money for myself, cooking, chopping wood to warm the house, shopping, talking to people, helping people.

 Also one of the jobs was in a bank which made me even more experienced in economic jobs, and kinda made me realize that I maybe should've gone at other path in uni instead of connecting my favourite hobby (gaming, technology) with computer science uni which made me dislike the uni even more. 

I am trying and I know that I will get back on the right path, but momentarily Im stuck in this mindset, that when I see people finishing uni in 8 semesters meanwhile I will finish it in 10, maybe 12 who knows, but still, I feel like I'll be late, but the other side of me says some stoic words in the context of, ""There is time for everything, and the main thing will come when the time is truly right"", and I believe in this, I know that the time will come and I will rise again, cause I was pretty successful student till uni, but went downhill.

2513,"So it was stupid really. In my early 20's I had a big fight with my brother, who was toxic and a bully. And I decided to cut him out for good. My parents didn't like the idea at all and were encouraging us to make up. My brother, being the toxic piece of shit as he was, faked sadness over my decision and pretended to reach out to me, but I told him off. This made my parents furious and they accused me of being a horrible person for holding a grudge against my own brother. But I'd had enough of his shit tbh. 

So I decided to cut them all out completely. I changed my phone number, Email etc and went the length to  make sure they wouldn't be able to reach me on online platforms like FB or Instagram. I even cut contacts with some of my childhood friends whom I assumed had been asked by my family to snoop around just to find out how I was doing. I was also already living in another city at the time so it made it easier for me to avoid them.

I have no idea what got into me today. I woke up and just grabbed my phone and dialed my dad's number, which luckily he still has all these years and I still know by heart. I'm pretty sure my voice has deepened a lot after years of smoking and because I am much older now.  I said 'hello' when it got through and my father went like 'Fred?'. He still recognized my voice. I talked with them for hours and not once my brother's name was even mentioned which I thanked them for and I believe they had been preparing for the day when I finally decided to mend our broken relationship.

We talked about everything. Their new house. Their trips to Iceland and North Pole years ago. The family,  all the weddings, births, and funerals I had missed. The cousins and nephews I never knew I had. We cried and then we laughed. They promise me they would come visit me next year. I told them they don't have to since I'll be 'coming home' for Christmas for the first time in ten years.
When I asked them casually how my brother was doing, my father's answer was short and he tried to change the subject. I love him for that. They know I may still not be ready to have him back in my life and they don't want to ruin our reunion. 

For the first time in years I no longer feel lonely. I mean I have a lot of friends here but I always felt like there's something missing. Sometimes, it's good to forgive and let go of the past. In my case, I realized my parents weren't entirely wrong to force me to give my brother another chance. They were just trying to be good parents. It's their job. But after ten years I think they have begun to understand that just because somebody is related to somebody else by blood, doesn't mean they're obligated to still be present in each other's live after years of pain and hummiliation.

2535,"I live in England at home with my two parents. At this time of year where we are the weather tends to be mild to cold with lots of Rain. 

We’ve got a dog and a fairly big garden for her to play in. We love at the top of a hill so as a result of this our garden ends with a foot high wall followed abruptly with an 8 foot drop directly down into someone else’s garden. 

This is covered by a hedgerow and various bit to stop our dog getting on it, recently though she found a hole and has started walking along the wall- No good,very dangerous, we’re putting a fence up to stop it. 

So Saturday arrives. 9:30am there’s knock on the door from the man delivering the fence panels and posts. Dad asks me to help him putting them up. 

At this point it has rained consistently from Thursday evening, until Saturday. Our garden is basically a bog. 

Reluctantly we both know we can’t delay the job as the dog will go out and we don’t want to risk it.

So there i was, waiting in my car for about 45 minutes, and this nice old man pulls up next to me, and asks if i need help. I said i was waiting for AAA, but if he wanted to take a look he could. Turns out, he was an old automotive teacher in the 60s-70s and he helped change my tire while giving me lessons on what to do and how to do it. Once AAA finally got to me, we had mounted the spare tire and we only needed them to fill it up with air! The man wouldn’t accept any cash and said that the good deed will repay itself in time. I thanked him repeatedly. He didn’t have to go out of his way to help me, much less teach me how to properly change my tires, but human kindness still exists, and I was reminded of that today.

2537,"I turned down a job after receiving multiple interviews and callbacks and am unsure how I feel about it.

Backstory: I recently graduated from college and still have no idea what I want to do for a living.

I had applied to a job for as a sales representative for solar energy and was about to head into the final round of interviews. However, the entire time I was really questioning how comfortable I would be in doing so. The job was over 40 minutes away by drive on the highway and I can barely drive right now, as I'm a newbie. I would also be outside going door to door in the cold of winter and during night hours as well. As a woman, it does make me concerned about my safety in a neighborhood I'm not familiar with, all by myself. I also didn't really like the job itself because I'm not a person that is super outgoing, but can be if I'm forced to, I suppose. The only real reason I was for taking it was because it was to help people convert to solar energy in their homes and the money I would receive.

When they called me again today, I turned down the final interview stating the travel was too far. I don't know if my decision was wise, or a complete mistake. I often feel like I play it too safe with myself in life, but this felt like I was putting myself in a situation I knew I wouldn't like or even grow to be comfortable with.","Declined a Job, Not Sure How I Feel About it",0

2542,"My proana, Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, you name it, I’m not there anymore for eating disorder purposes. I struggled with anorexia from ages 11 to 14, and it was a terrible time. I made a gruelling, but successful recovery and didn’t think twice about it until a few months ago when I realized I had gained weight over quarantine and my favourite clothes didn’t fit like they used to. 

I started out trying to lose weight in a healthy way, but as a once eating disordered person often does, i went back to my old ways. I rejoined a lot of my old communities and started to pick up a few of my old habits. In my mind, I was just using a few unorthodox methods to lose a few pounds, but I could feel it becoming poisonous: I was tired all the time, I kept lowering my calorie goals, I was irritable and I was throwing away perfectly good food to keep up the prétense that I was eating to my parents. My self esteem plummeted, especially now that I was being bombarded with images of dubiously thin people on tik tok showing off their weight and dancing, a kind of thinspo I’d never seen before. 

I knew I was going out with my grandma today, and I was up all night yesterday trying to brainstorm excuses for not eating. But as I was in the car with her today trying to come up with something to say, it hit me full force how disordered I had become again. Healthy people don’t agonize over whether they deserve lunch even after skipping breakfast, you know?

2543,"I just listened all the way through the Smile Sessions, the highly expected album from the Beach Boys in '67 that Brian Wilson couldn't finish, and it was INCREDIBLE.

It gives me so many mixed emotions: on one hand I loved it and am so appreciative of the producers who took all the original recordings and made the original album come to life with the blessing and help of Brian who sat in.

On the other hand it makes me kinda sad for what could've been in the moment of 1967. What a triumphant response to Pet Sounds it could've been if not for Brian's mental health issues.

All in all it's beautiful and you can tell there is something truly special there, underneath it all. It's just a shame Brian wasn't able to unlock it in the moment.

2544,"Since the pandemic started, my routine has become pretty solitary. I work from home and have barely gone out socially since March. I took up running to stay fit and maintain some routine. 

I run in a quiet suburb near to where I live and the area is peppered with stray cats. About two month ago, a litter of kittens cropped up. One of them was super friendly. He would rub against my legs and weave in between them when I would try to walk away. I was pretty fond of this cat so I remembered its coat. Unfortunately, the litter eventually disbanded.

Most of these cats live in clusters spread across the suburb. There's one cluster of cats I see often. They usually don't react to people passing by and just lay around. I've only seen them react to those who feed them. The other day, I was walking home from my evening run and passed by this cluster. It was pretty dark since the area is sparsely lit. Usually unmoved, one of them sprung to their feet and trotted to me. The rest followed shortly after meowing and circling my legs. They were suddenly very excited to see me and most of them let me pet them. One of them even sat on my shoes and started purring!

The first one to move was the cat from the litter two month ago. He's much bigger now but I recognised that coat. It was great to see him healthy, happy and integrated into a pack of his own. It made my day! It was such a cute and wholesome experience and added some variety to my otherwise boring days.",Ambushed by cats,0

My station is one of the last on the local line so after a couple more it started to get faster and properly head out of the city.

It was dark at the time so I couldnt really see much except for the odd line of lights for a depot/road. The whole train was pretty empty and it was going fast too. Was a little on edge at first but relaxed after a while and actually enjoyed it. I had a book on hand and the rumble of the engine made it nice to relax and read.

I just got my first car!!

It was my grandfathers car however he can no longer drive so I will be slowly buying it (small amount each month) off my grandmother.

It’s a scuffed up, scratched, dented old Nissan Note, nothing fancy, but it’s mine!

I have been learning to drive in my dads modestly powerful diesel, so my little note is surprisingly much harder. It’s got old, grey interior and an old radio, super old gearstick, pedals, screens but I love it! I’ve been given the keys and told to drive it myself as often as possible up and down our road (private, don’t worry).

It feels incredible to have a wee car of my own.

But if I’ve put that much just into one game, imagine how much I’ve put just into gaming in general. I probably have a year of my life while awake at the bare minimum of just gaming.

Then there was the dream. This was the icing on the cake. I NEVER dream or at least remember them. If I do I’ll only remember a bit of it and quickly forget it. But like my sleep this dream was different. It felt real in a way I can’t describe. I remember every part of it. It wasn’t even anything too exciting.

Then I woke up. I wake up usually at 8 or so this time I woke up at 11. And normally I’m reluctant to wake up and I’ll sit in bed on Reddit for an hour all groggy. But I woke up and was quite happy. I actually felt refreshed. I didn’t sit on Reddit. I got up and had made a nice breakfast.

2558,"Whenever I encounter a new idea, my brain's instant reaction is to turn to the realm of meta-thoughts (e.g., ""this concept seems hard to break down"", ""this concept could be so useful to me once I master it"", etc.).

While such a train of thought can potentially be useful as a *parallel* thread of thinking, when it becomes the prime (and only) mode of thinking, it becomes detrimental to the process of *actual* thinking. It's almost as if I fantasize about the act of thinking (the same goes for writing), but when I get down to it, my thinking (or writing) breaks down due to a multitude of factors (whether it's low self-esteem (""This is going nowhere...""), distractions, reduced motivation, or perhaps boredom).

I want to change this. Unfortunately, I have also been battling intense mental fog along with a whole bunch of medical issues all of 2020, and this makes it physically harder to stay focused on my thoughts.

You can not eat right, do an exercise incorrectly before you realize you wasted a shitload of time working the wrong muscle, get injured, etc.  

It’s just that I don’t have much in my personal life, whereas it seems everyone I know has SOMETHING in their life that they’re good at.  Im aware it should be a hobby to relieve stress, but I want to be good at it and get noticeable results just so if every other aspect of life sucks, It can be that thing which gives me confidence.

I asked her if she was at work and if she needed to call back and she goes ""no don't worry about it!"" 

I know she was probably having a work conversation with a co-worker but she didn't hesitate to answer (it only rang twice) and put her other conversation on hold. I just really appreciate her and feel so grateful to be loved and supported as much as she makes it clear she loves and supports me.

2565,"Many many years ago, when I was in high school taking AP English Language, we only had one assignment for the quarter when midterm grades were due. Everyone was failing at midterms because no one turned in the assignment. She allowed redo's and I had too many other AP assignments at the same time. Keep in mind that I took 7 AP courses that year (recommended is 3-5 and I'm pretty sure everyone else was on the low end), so I was BUSY. But I chose not to turn in the assignment, owned up to it, and completed it with the redo.

The principal had us each write a letter to him explaining why we were failing. EVERYONE (\~7 students) blamed the teacher for being a bad teacher and did not take responsibility for choosing to not turn in the assignment. She was the teacher who taught me to really write and she was also very nice. Anyways, the principal called me into his office to reprimand me for lying that I was failing due to my own choices. And then when the students kicked me out of the class (yeah, you read that right), there was no support from the leadership. So I had to learn the rest of the course on my own in the library during that class period. This was one of many incidents where I was not supported when being bullied.

\~5 years later, the principal asked me to tutor his son. And I did. But man I was thinking of the irony. No idea why I just thought of this, but here it is.","I was the only one to take responsibility for my choice to not turn in an assignment and therefore was failing at midterm.

They were usually pretty embarrassing pranks that always ended up in the parents verbally abusing them. I always found their videos as... hmm. How do it put it? Unbearably terrible. All the abuse and pranks their parents did to them not only traumatized them, but having a worse impact on the children themselves. They prank each other, in a childish way, but it later evolves into sibling abuse. Then, in 2017, they lost custody of the 2 younger children by the CPS. They deny any of it is real and it is all staged, but CPS didn’t believe it. I just wanna talk about it and really see what you think.

2568,"I just heard the song on the radio today and it truly resonates for our current times. This made me feel a little sad because our society still hasn’t evolved and we are through a whole new generation of mistakes. I was 16 years old when I first heard it and it seemed like a great song at the time and seemed like it brought people together. Maybe I have coastal bias or maybe I was just too young to see what was really going on around me because I lived in a middle class white-ish neighborhood. But LIFE, especially in our current society, has really opened my eyes to all the hate that exists. Am I naive to think this song could have an effect now? Am I an idiot to not have seen all the hate and discrimination happening since 2003?

2569,"I'm 16, and ever since I can remember, I loved reading books. I read all the classics like a room of one's own, old man and the sea, great expectations, etc before I was 10. Virginia Woolf was always my favourite author, and I had read nearly all her books. However, gradually, I became afraid of reading books, as, for me, it took so much effort to read simple and easy words, and I had to often read the entire page again to comprehend the meaning correctly. Even on Reddit, I always have to edit stuff as I can almost never write anything without misspelling something or the other.

Reading books for academic purposes also became a horrendous task for me, and hence, as it took me triple the time as others to read stuff, I eventually stopped story reading books altogether. I started having headaches when I read anything and became depressed very soon and as a consequence, my grades started slipping. No one understood what was happening to me, and they just thought ""I wasn't trying hard enough"". The pressure and anxiety led me to have multiple panic attacks and eventually start self-harming.

I felt so helpless and alone like it was unfair that I was going through something no one will ever understand, and something most people don't even know or care about!

Then, one day when I was 14, my library teacher came and confronted me. I was very close to her as I used to spread most of my time in school at the library and she often discussed and recommended books to me. When she asked me why I hadn't been coming to the library lately and if everything was okay, I broke down and started crying, and I explained everything to her. She patiently listened to me and comforted me. She told me that I was mistaken to believe that people didn't care about me and that she wanted me to know that she would always be there for me.

No one had ever asked me if I was alright before, and her words touched me so much that I obtained the courage to try reading books again. She helped me find books that would be easier for me to read, and eventually, even though dyslexia still makes it hard for me to read simple paragraphs, for the first time in my life, I have been able to slightly subdue it!

I finally started reading Virginia Woolf's ""Flush"" last month, and today, I finished reading the last page! No one knows how I feel right now, and I can't tell anyone that I feel over the moon, so instead, I decided to share it here, hoping that someone cares!

2612,"I have a very early-onset schizophrenia, mostly due to a childhood abuse I endured. Life wasn't great. I couldn't go to therapist for years, because I live in a country where my condition isn't tolerated (is it tolerated anywhere?). When I got to adulthood, I basically stopped living. I just didn't care where life takes me. Then I started eating obsessively. Eating makes you feel nice, right? Well, that didn't go well, because by last year, I gained over 250 pounds. 

To get to the point, my sister and I have a very strained relationship. Less than two years ago, she had falling out with her husband, and I agreed for her and her 2 year old daughter to live with me for as long as she wants. I spent a lot of time with my niece - playing with her, taking her to places, etc. 

Well, anyway, realizing that I might not be completely worthless, I guess it got to me. I stopped slacking behind and started losing weight intensively. I got a good therapist and everything. In like a year, I lost over 80 pounds. I get far less hallucinations and voices in my head seem calmer. I'm pursuing my education more and do whatever so that she wouldn't feel like her uncle is wasting his life. 

It's so weird, because I didn't understand how much my niece means to me until I started processing how much I changed in just a year. It was especially nice to see her crying when I had to leave for couple of months. I know, I sound like a sadist, but it's just realizing that she cares meant so much to someone like me.",6 months with my niece managed to completely change me,0

The last few months, I've been finding it harder to feel like a real person. I've been struggling to find work since redundancy due to covid cutbacks, and just felt a bit aimless in my own personal life living in continuous lockdown.

2622,"First of all, I’m new to this subreddit, so hello! This one seems very peaceful and comfortable compared to the rest...

I’m an eighteen year old male who’s too sensitive for his own good, and it makes my life unnecessarily difficult at times. I allow arguments to reside in my head for far too long, usually feeling in the wrong after a squabble, and it sometimes makes me feel like a terrible person. I had been waking around school through the morning, try to focus on getting my assignments done. I was pretty miserable, that is, until psychology class.

Now, I’ve been told before that meditation helps, but I was stubborn and couldn’t wrap my head around the concept of feeling better through emptying your mind. However, we tried it as part of class today, and it was truly a miracle to look at these problems from a third party perspective. It helped me realized that, it was just a mistake, a misunderstanding over a certain situation. Confrontations with strangers won’t affect your entire life, and it’s easier to just let these situations go and learn from your mistakes.

While I still believe that this person was in the right in the conversation, I was upset over the rather ugly way they voiced it, as I was just confused and wasn’t intentionally trying to hurt anyone’s feelings. But sometimes it’s best to realize from a completely neutral standpoint, absent from your emotions or anyone else’s that some things aren’t worth holding onto.

I hope that I was fairly civil throughout this post, as I’d like to appeal to a mature community. And I advise anyone who’s feeling stressed, guilty, or bitter to engage in a simple meditation video. While I cannot say for sure that it will help everyone, it may help to just take a breath and analyze the situation that’s troubling you.",First meditation experience.,0

It was a amazing plan and me being the dumb little sister who idolized her brother agreed to this. 

This was elaborately staged. The kidnapping happened in the living room where my parents were sitting. They didn't pay much attention because they thought we were just being silly. It was not the reaction that bro expected so he took me to his room and told me to sit in the balcony and locked the door. Then presumably he went to negotiate the terms of my release with the 'rents and that took longer than expected. 

Now I really really really really had to pee. Bro's and my rooms were side by side and I could easily jump from his balcony to mine and go pee. Or so I thought.  I stood up on a chair in the balcony and tried to grab the rails of my balcony but slipped and fell 2 storeys down.

2651,"The year is 2000. I’m in kindergarten and working with a TA on some small project about our favorite animals. 

I had a big interest on ocean animals at that point and had looked at a bunch of pictures of different kinds of whales recently. I was enamored by the narwhal. I was told unicorns weren’t real but this is pretty gosh darn close. 

So I tell the TA I want to do mine on narwhals. She’s confused and asks what it is. So I go on describing how’s it’s this whale with a huge long horn like a unicorn. She’s a bit flabbergasted and says we need to do real animals, no sea animals have horns like that. I correct myself in hopes it will make a difference and tell her it’s actually a tooth.

It's no secret we disagree a lot on politics, but we try to be cool about it. But some of the things they believe, particularly one friend, are just outrageous in my opinion.

Im a pretty left leaning person, and the friend in question is pretty conservative. Recently the discussion of the protests and riots came up, and it's been... a ride. First off, he believes that Floyd overdosed, and that's how he died. Obviously, I disagree and tell him that that's ridiculous. He also often victim blames Floyd (""If he complied, he'd be alive"", ""He was saying I can't breathe before he was on the ground"", etc), but says he doesn't condone the murder. 

It then evolves into how riots have causes injuries and property damage, which I acknowledge. However, when I started to bring up right wing protests / counter protests, he got really weird and claiming BLM and Antifa always start the violence and the proud boys, etc. Never start fights but always finish them. Even after another friend and I showed him videos of the case, he would dismiss them and always refer to the looting and fires, which just always seem to be worse in his eyes. He would also seem to ignore certain points I make and go off on things I already responded to before.

After a while of arguing, I just said we should stop and said goodnight. I know there is more to friendship than politics, and that people who disagree on things can still get along well, but this really irritated me and made me question the kind of person he is.

Am I in the wrong, is there something I can do to at least get him to acknowledge my points? Is there something I'm now acknowledging from him? Can people who disagree as much as we do be friends?",It's so hard to stay friends with someone I disagree with,0

2661,"I've always (in my adult life) handled criticism better than compliments. In an internship (Christ, 20 years ago...), I had no problem handling ""You have a problem seeing the chores when it's in front of you, work on this."", but a week later ""Hey, you pulled through, and it's nice to see how well you adapted."" made me cry in a bathroom. This was not an isolated incident.

  
I wanted to write this down now, because today, I had a job-evaluation. Somewhere on the list was *'things I do good'* and *'things I can do better'*, and I immediately said ""Let's talk about *'can do better'* first."", surprising my boss, since that wasn't the order on the form.  
To make matters weirder, when she asked me my opinion, ""*What I can do better*"", I had a few bullet points, but ""*What positive influence do I have on my workplace?*"" left me speechless.  
On some level I can rationalize that some of the things I do, I do well, but it feels as if consciously admitting that, even in my own head, is...wrong.  


Even the things I'm passionate about and KNOW I'm good at, I'm not able to just 'take the compliment and move on'. It's either ""*They're wrong, it's not as great as they think, but arguing might hurt their feelings.*"" or ""*That's just lying, or politeness, and not what they REALLY think*.""

2662,"My family is Malaysian Chinese (I’m first generation Australian) and our food is a mix of Cantonese, Hokkien, Teohchew, Nyonya, Malay and Indian food. I have aaaalllways loved all of it - the pickled flavours, the spice, the hot broths, the clean cooking styles, the fermented ingredients. Not stuff you get at Chinese restaurants. Real home cooked, passed down for generations recipes. Sit at the dining table and watch grandma chop ingredients meals. No measurement, no cookbooks, just “sprinkle until your heart is happy” type stuff. My housemate is also Korean so there’s always kimchi and gochujang sitting in my fridge somewhere.

I’ve always been slightly apprehensive about cooking my ethnic foods for anyone but myself. I’m a good cook, but I always tend to stick to the meat and 2 veg or pasta end of the spectrum when cooking for other people. I’ve had people open my fridge before and say “ew, this smells weird”; I’ve had boyfriends shudder if I ate spam or something fermented or even cooked in a different way to what they’re used to; my brother’s girlfriend even staunchly refuses to eat some of the things my family makes.

My SO has shown an interest in spicy foods and more ethnic ingredients like bone marrow, mustard greens, fermented soy beans, more medicinal-tasting spice mixes, etc. Stuff he’s never been exposed to partly because he’s from a real meat and potatoes British family. The few times I have made Chinese food he’s finished absolutely everything and then shyly asked me again for more days later. We’ll even go shopping and he’ll suggest or pick out stuff that he remembers me cooking so I can make it again, and when my dad said he could teach us over a zoom call he was so excited.

So today we spoke to my parents and they were telling us about all these recipes we should try, so after the call I decided to stock up, and I took him to a Chinese supermarket. We wandered around in total fascination and even came home with his own things, and stuff for his parents to try. He’s so amazed by all the ingredients in my kitchen. He’ll just open bottles and stick in a spoon and eat them and go “WOW that’s a new taste!!”

Tomorrow I’m going to make him traditional congee and I think he’ll really like it!

I’ve never been with anyone who is so completely fascinated by my Chinese cooking and actually asks for more. I never knew what it felt like to not be worried that someone would reject my food and by extension my culture and myself. It always felt like hiding, and now I don’t have to anymore.

He is ''lazy'' in that it is a chore to get him out of his room, he only does so if it matters

&amp;#x200B;

on my side of things, I was smoking weed this morning and this ''revelation'' kicked in that I NEED to re-bond with my brother, I came to the assumption that maybe he is suffering from depression becase of the huge lack of human interaction at this stage of his life which was me a few years ago where I attempted suicide twice, and I do NOT want this to be the case for my brother, and that I just generally feel so fcking bad and guilty that I was never there for him as the older brother...

And as much as Im a gamer, we play on two different platforms, I also think he maybe ADHD or autistic since he has been playing world of tanks of the ps4 for days upon days layed out for multiple years, I was astonished when I realized he had like 3/4 PS4 games total, but hardly touches the other 3...

However, it is Diwali in India now, and my wife is more than a thousand miles away with our domestic cat, and the semi-feral one is snuggled up to me for the past few days, with all the loud bangs from the crackers around us.

2702,"Hello,
I am a pretty nostalgic person so I often drift into a moment from the past during the day and try to remember the feelings I had back then and compare it to the stuff I am feeling at the present time. It seems like a long process but it is just a momentary thing and usually takes about a couple seconds and most of the time it leaves me with a smile. Most of the time it will be because something reminded me of that thing in the past but sometimes I reminiscence about random stuff too. I moved to Italy two months ago, I know it was not the best timing but it was the best option I had, and since 10 days we are under lockdown again, a ""light lockdown"" if you will. Lately I find myself subconsciously creating excuses to buy some non-essential stuff from supermarket so that I can go out. But when I go to the supermarket I feel super ashamed because everyone is buying a lot of supplies indicating that they are doing their shopping in order to reduce their need to buy something for the following days, meanwhile I am there in the line waiting with just 1kg of bananas in my hand. So, before going to bed just now, I had this vision of myself in the future where I would be freely shopping and casually entering the supermarket just for a gum or something, then probably noticing that nobody has masks on their faces and having one of my seconds-long flashbacks, exiting the market with a smile. That would be an amazing day I am sure. 

Cheers.","I am looking forward to the moment I would say ""oh, look nobody is wearing masks""",0

He really did fight in the colloseum, but the fights were rigged &amp; he loved chopping heads off ostriches.

2715,"possible trigger warning, lots of talk of food and appetite in this post/

I’ve struggled a lot with depression and appetite issues for the past few years. I also fucking *love* cooking and honestly? I can be pretty damn good at it. 

It’s hard to enjoy cooking when you have a very limited appetite though. On a good day, I *may* be able to convince myself to make a peanut butter sandwich even when I have no appetite, but I won’t turn the kitchen upside down with ingredients and a recipe that takes a bit of work and time if I don’t even feel like eating. 

Which kind of sucks, because I see all these things I wanna make and eat and sometimes I even plan to make a certain dish on a certain day, but that day comes around and all I can stomach are some crackers. Fruits and veggies and other foods go bad a lot because I go through long periods of struggling to eat. 

But I’m back. Slowly and surely, and after lots of different treatments for my mental health, I’m eating not one, not two, but sometimes even three meals a day! I look at each meal as an opportunity to create something exciting and delicious, so having a more normal appetite is really exciting.

Anyways, I’m eating leftover homemade fried rice and some (vegetarian) orange chicken. I’m trying to plan what to have for dinner, as I was gonna make fried tofu sandwiches but my boyfriend is going to have dinner at his parents, and I’d like some help on those.

It just felt like they'd always been asking about me and my brothers, and that unless they were asked they'd have never really told us these stories.

I started to get quite worried that I wouldn't record them in time and that something may happen and the thought that my neices may never be old enough to remember them or how funny my grandad is got me into a bit of a run with it. I tried looking at ways to store them so that I could listen to them at any time and struggled to find anything that did what I was hoping to achieve with them and ended up creating an app called ParleSound (only available on the Play Store at the moment because I want to see if it's helpful for people and actually achieves its purpose).

For the first time the other day I had my niece ask questions to my gran and recorded it via my app and ended up feeling relieved that i'd finally gone about doing it.

I do think that the console was well marketed and they tried to show that there were games for everyone but the X-Box has games like Halo and others at the time that had bigger appeal.",Pulled out my old GameCube system. Still Works like a Charm,0
2733,"Just had two phone calls from two of my best friends. We’re all dealing with fears of COVID, politics, economy, etc. Just a short conversation with my close friends made me feel better in spite of my internal conversation with myself.

2734,"Hey :\] Hope you all are doing well. As the title suggests I'm kind of tired of being friends with someone I am attracted to - they know it and they don't feel the same. I'm not sure how to get over how I feel because I almost never get attracted to people (only my 2nd time and I'm turning 21 soon). I was hoping to just ignore them and get a move on because this has been bugging me for so long (more than a year now) and it's starting to bringing out my insecurities about how I look.

 I wish I could just normally get over someone but yeah seeing them everyday, going to classes, spending weekend nights together with other friends, etc. just make it really bad. And I've tried talking to other people just to find someone else to be attracted to (aka a rebound which is scumbag ik but) but yeah shit don't work, man. 

Last night we were drunk and they go ""Oh, man I'm yearning for someone with x, y, z."" and I mean of course they don't have to hold themselves back around me and be dishonest but it made me feel like shit and with the alcohol added to the experience it really made me feel worse than I have in a while.

Anyway, yeah that's kind of all I wanted to rant about really. Stay safe during covid season, bros.",I'm not sure what to title this but I'm just tired of being friends with someone I am attracted to,0
2735,"   I have watched The Incredibles from a young age. It was a common choice for movie night, and my entire family could almost quote the entire thing. Our favorite character was Edna, and we spouted off her dialogue often.

   So, as you can imagine, we were very excited for the long awaited sequel. More Jack-Jack backstory? Cool! A new villain? Awesome! Better animation? Sweet!

   However, after the whole thing was said and done, we were a little disappointed, all with different things.

   My mom was annoyed with the voice of Elastagirl, as the nasal quality in her dialogue had increased tenfold from the original.

   My dad was disappointed that it didn’t hark back to the original at all except for a few small parts. You could probably watch the sequel on its own with very little confusion.

   I was angry about the lack of real story and the many, *many* plot holes. What happened to the Underminer, for example? And what about all the character development from the original? It’s like the characters stagnated just for the sake of the sequel.

   Of course, sequels are never as good as the original. I’m fine with that. I, admittedly, kind of expected that. But this movie was promised for fourteen years, worked on for fourteen years, slaved over for fourteen years. It’s almost like thirteen and a half of those years were spent on the animation, and the last six months were actually spent on the story. It’s just...underwhelming. Disappointing. A bit of a let down.

   But here’s the thing. I’m a bit of a purist when it comes to The Incredibles. I have watched it from a young age, and remember a lot of details that most would not. After all, it’s a very strange movie to fixate on as a family.

   How do all of you like the new Incredibles movie? Do you love it, hate it, or was it just meh? I want to know if I am the only one who thought it was a flop.",The Incredibles 2: Good or Bad?,0
2736,"My family never really understood just how bad sugar was.  We always have multiple 12 packs of soda on hand just to drink.  Since I was 5, I've always looked at drinking soda or, if I wanted to be a bit healthier, juice as just normal.  Drinking water was a chore or ""necessary."" I would even turn to Gatorade instead if I was feeling dehydrated.  Even in High School, I made a deal with my friend that we would quit soda for a year, right? But I wasn't any better, I just drank Arizona teas, which are just as bad.

I realized today, though, that I was reaching for a cup of water without even thinking if I had a soda I liked in the fridge (which I realize now I don't have a soda I like.)  If I do buy soda for myself, it's always diet or low/no carb, and only one a day.  If I want flavor in my water, I use my Cirkul bottle, which adds even less than those Mio flavor enhancers.  As for things like candy and pastries, I've been off of those for a while.  Realized years ago that I don't really like candy or cakes.

I wanted to celebrate as I plan my next big change, which is to cut down on my caffeine.  That's so bad that I barely feel the effects of one of those big screw cap Monsters.

What about everyone else? Any big personal accomplishments?  Maybe any stories about how you've done something similar?","I think I've finally kicked my sugar addiction! My family doesn't really understand, but they're happy for me!",0

When I was in 4th grade during recess a school mate gave me sh*t for my home life. (Which sucked.) It was devastating.

2760,"I was really inspired by my friend to make this post. I went to a small town with 1000 people and i pretty much knew every one who was in my school and their parents. Same went with my friend. I knew him as an acquaintance since we were 14 and at 14, he was a kid that got excited about everything no matter how simple it was. He would treasure every moment and always be super happy. He would never keep something on his chest and he would be completely honest about a everything. It wasn't with a hurtful intention, but if I wanted a real answer or someone to have a real conversation with, I would have went to him because he would give it to me straight. The thing was because he was so bubbly and happy all the time, not everyone was his fan and he would get bullied a lot for that. But it never bothered him.

We both went to the city for college (we both got into the same place) and he was the only one I knew on the big campus. So as per usual we became friends. And the bullying for him  stopped and people recognized that even with the stress of school, he was still happy. He would be excited to go to class and learn something new. He loved doing his homework, loved going to all these college events even if they didn't match his ""interests"" because it was a way to make a memory. I honestly didn't get it at the time, but I started realizing how much I wish I had that happy personality. He would be happy if I gave him a donut. I'd be like its a 2 dollar donut and he would tell me how hard donuts are to make and he enjoys it with all his heart.

So fast forward to present day, we went to grab a slice of pizza together after work and the pizza got a little over cooked. I an extremely picky eater and I asked for another one. He took the slightly over cooked pizza and ate it all with a smile on his face. I asked him, how do you enjoy eating something with a burnt taste, and he said I don't enjoy it, but if me eating something happily makes the person who makes this feel happy, I'll laugh like im being tickled. I was like but what about yourself. He was like thats the difference between you and I, you need a reason to be happy, whereas I am happy all the time and I enjoy myself a lot more in even horrible situations.

I leave you the review of the history of my book:
""'Year 3840. after waking up from a mysterious blackout and not remembering almost anything that led him to that situation, a soldier of the special forces of the Universal Government of the New Humanity must discover the reason   of why humanity is on the brink of extinction, losing the war against a fierce enemy against whom He remembers that humanity was winning in other times. The answer to all that will go beyond what the soldier could have imagined and that will change the history of the universe forever""
I can't stand it haha i am so excited that I'll give a little of spoiler: i think that perhaps the review of the book makes those who know/fans of science fiction think that the soldier woke up in another dimension but I assure you that this is NOT how things happened.

Well, today we finally decided to splurge on something and I can't believe we're getting a Dyson V11 ^((omg!!!))

I would never have imagined that we'd be people who'd spend $400 on a freakin' vacuum cleaner. Adulting right? Almost all of our appliances and furniture are from second-hand shops. But our old vacuum is 10 years old and it sucks. Poorly!

Just want to justify this impulse buying with the fact that we have respiratory problems and that our air purifier is constantly on red alert, basically telling us how useless our 10-year-old vacuum is.

Thanks to that Facebook ad that told me there was a mega-sale at a local electronics shop, or else would never have thought to get a Dyson vacuum at all. It's coming tomorrow!

Anywho, one thing I quickly learned switching to vegetarianism is that it's a way bigger pain in the ass to eat vegetarian in America than you might think.

I love salads but it just sucks having like one legit entree option anywhere you go. Except Indian restaurants.

It doesn't take long at all to develop a taste for Indian food. They have some of them best sauces in the world imo.

We were in our city a week or so ago walking through a park and there were big oak trees lining one side. The acorns were everywhere on the sidewalks and lining the flower beds. I grabbed a couple because I'm one of those people that picks up nice looking rocks, and I guess that expands to smooth pretty acorns. A few days later we were in another town when we passed up a huge old oak and there were these giant acorns carpeting the ground under it. These ones had caps that were spiky. It made them look like they were wearing wigs. Then today we were at a pond walking and I found a teeny tiny oak with teeny tiny acorns the size of my pinky nail. I also found weird pine cones that look like roses, and weird giant nuts that I don't know what they are yet. 

I've got them all in a mug on the bookshelf and I'm considering following some directions I found on google to sprout them so they can be planted in the spring.

2809,"So basically, you buy packs of 10 cards for $5, for use with this game.

There are 3 types of cards:

* Character cards, which show your character's picture and list their stats. Each character has an attack number and a health number. The higher the attack number, the stronger it can attack. The higher the health number, the more damage it can take. Every character has 3 attacks: one strong, one mega, and one super.
* Power cards, which increase your power of your attacks. Each power card has a level increase for your strong, mega, and super attacks. The highest level an attack can be is level 5.
* Ultra cards, which give you access to an ultra attack. The higher the number, the stronger the ultra attack. All characters have a type: either light, medium, or heavy. If you use an ultra card of the same type as your character, the ultra attack will hit harder.

In the IRL card game, each pack of cards comes with 2 dice. One die has a different attack on each side. The strong and mega attack each show up on two sides, while the super and ultra attacks each show up one side. The other die is a standard numerical die. Each of the 2 players should have their own set of these dice.

What you do is pull out one character card, and optionally one power and/or one ultra card. Then you roll your dice, and whoever's numbered die gets the higher number gets to use whatever attack the other die landed on. If you don't have an ultra card and roll an ultra, you'll use your super attack.

If you attack, then multiply your character's attack number by your attack's power level, and subtract that number from your opponent's health number. Whoever's health number reaches zero first loses.

After the game is over, the winning player must choose which of their opponent's 3 cards they wanna take, but must also give their opponent one of their 3 cards.

In the mobile app game, the first thing to do is to scan your character card using your QR code reader. If you don't have a character card, the game will assign you a character randomly. Then scan your power card, and finally your ultra card, should you have either of them. Then the game will pair you with an opponent.

The game is played in a simple way: your 3 types of attacks (and your ultra attack if you scanned an ultra card) will be on a slot, and another slot will have a series of numbers. There's 2 big buttons: the red one will stop the attack slot, and the blue one will stop the number slot. Whoever gets the bigger number fires off the attack they landed on. The first player to KO their opponent's character wins.

After the game is over, each player will be rewarded one digital, in-game card of a random selection. However, for 50 cents, they can have a physical card sent to them by mail if they so desired.

2817,"People don't communicate well because what is needed to be able to communicate well is the ability to be upfront and honest with what is bothering you.

I feel like people have a tendency to just want to believe that they're invincible and too strong or too good to be upset by the world, that when they actually are, admitting that is too difficult to deal with, so instead they'd just rather command the world around them.

""If something is bothering me, then that is my fault for being weak.""

But really, you can solve your problems by your weakness and not just by your strength.

I see this so often, in personal and professional settings.

Rather than being  truthful and open about  personal grievances, people would rather just automatically react by assuming positions of authority and command. ""I can make the world better by controlling it and controlling others.""

THIS IS AN AWFUL WAY TO DEAL WITH INTERPERSONAL ISSUES IN YOUR LIFE.

What this approach says is, ""My needs and my perspectives are more important than yours."", which  enforces a dynamic of only one of our needs can matter. This means that other people will see respecting you and giving you what you want as an implicit disservice to their needs and wants. That dynamic INVITES CONFLICT, as a lot of people do not want to ignore their own personal needs and wants.

You can not just command the world into being how you want to see it.

It's as if these people believe that without authority that nothing can go their way.

More often than not, people care about how they're treating others in the workplace and in life and are willing to get on the same page as you for the sake of it, but making life about you **or** me, instead of you **and** me, then your needs are more likely to intentionally be combatted for the sake of avoiding loss.

Why can't people just say ""This bothers me because XYZ."", and then have their needs addressed, rather than trying to coerce and pervert the world around them? Why is everything a war?

If you try to be open and honest about your needs, people will :

\-understand you better

\-not see you an an obstacle to *their* life

\-not resent you for invalidating their personal way of life, and therefore respect you

2821,"I have eczema
It’s not the end of the world but the place I have it sucks. (Get your head out the gutter!! ). My eczema predominately resides on my nape and I also have had a bad spell on the front of my neck (at one point it had gotten really bad and it looked like my neck had been slit, it was kind of fun to joke with, but it hurt terribly).

I’ve noticed I’ve been itching the back of my head a lot lately. I’m externally hygienic so I knew it wasn’t just my hair needing a wash. I realized, with the help of my trusty flashlight and overgrown nails, that when I itched my scalp my skin was literally flaking. I’ve also noticed more hair on my brush than usual. The natural conclusion... ✨*my eczema is spreading*✨

I’ve already lost a good amount for hair on my nape but because my hair is curly and big (I’m not very knowledgeable when it comes to hair, but I think my hair type is 3c... idk if there is a 3D... but if there was it would be really cool to say..) I’ve been able to not have to worry about my eczema. 

I’m typically not insecure about things I can’t see. (I save the crying for my body 😎 and the occasional zit) but I’m super worried about losing even more hair and I’m becoming insecure about the back of my neck which my hair covers. It’s a strange feeling. But when I feel eyes on the back of my head or am standing in front of someone I feel so awkward and gross. 

I’m trying my best to keep it all in check. I’m washing my hair more often, I’m sticking to cleaner hair products, and I’ve (of course) been moisturizing a million times a day. But there seems to be no cure for the insecurities I’m feeling over hair loss. While I know I don’t know a lot about hair care, I really like my hair. It’s bouncy and fluffy and makes me feel like a poodle.   I feel like I’m losing something I really care about, and something that other people may even find me attractive for (which is naive and I’m definitely not proud about feeling that way but it’s true). 

Any tips on insecurities you can’t see ? 
Any tips of recommendations on how to treat eczema in your scalp? 
Any products that would help? 


If you’d like to help me figure this out : 
//I’m thrive in a constant state of stress. I’m extremely organized and I like to work in a fast environment but maybe the stress has physically manifested into hair loss ? 
// I also don’t eat very much and haven’t gotten my cycle in a while. Im pretty sure I’m not underweight but I know I’m losing weight. It could be a nutrition thing.

That resulted in a lot of self isolation and food related anxiety all the time.

That was followed with eating around 1 other person instead of alone, silently. And finally, today I got over a huge fear of talking about food I have previously had, in this case fast food. 

It seems like a small feat but after battling food related anxiety for so long this was massive! Considering I'm not opening up to friends/family about this I felt the need to share with the whole world :)

I play a very popular shooting game causally. And I often play it on a European community server where there is about 30 people at once.

Tonight, I was trying a novice move when I heard 2 other guys commenting something like 'look at him he's practicing'.It was said in such a rude and condescending tone that I cannot even explain or describe. (Language barrier). I immediately understood that their earlier comments were about me as well.

At least 15 people can hear that on team radio.

I was not welcome and those guys thought that I was not even smart enough to understand their jokes and comments about me.Perhaps they did not know that I understand in their language or they didn't care.

I got very embarrassed and immediately said 'Hey I was just playing for fun. I'm sorry guys I didn't realize that was disturbing' and deleted the game.

I also don't really think ideas are something that come from nothing, they don't really belong to us, they're always travelling and if you're on the right moment then you might be able to catch it and translate it into artistic language. Nothing is more disheartening than finding out that the person behind something you enjoy is a terrible person, but in some cases their creation can be saved and that's a positive outcome.",Do you guys separate the art from the artist?,0
2866,"I know for myself it's been a huge struggle between my desire to lead an environmentally friendly life and increased consumption needs due to the pandemic (hand sanitizer, masks, cleaning products, etc). That's not even getting into increased online ordering.

There are ways to reduce the footprint of these things, but it's also ok to struggle with it and to sometimes veer away from your typical values. 

Eg. I have been using reusable cloth masks for the most part but now that things are getting really bad where I live, I think I'd feel safer adding filters to my masks and those aren't reusable, or switching to disposable surgical masks.

It all went down in Twitter when a Malay(Majority) claim that whatever the Indian girl tweeted was bullshit and no such things happen. I replied saying that if it doesn't happen around him ,it doesn't mean it never happens and that reply of his was really ignorant. 

We went back and forth on a topic that shouldn't even be argued about and called the girl racist for generalising her statement of us indians being opressed. I gave up at that point. 

What is it with people? I remember the times when I was in primary school (7-12 years) called a keling (racial slur) countless times and not able to do anything about it. I felt powerless as I watch them bully me. There was no use if I complain to a teacher as most of them are Malays and they wouldn't take it seriously. A common thing that they say to shit us up is "" balik kampung la India ni"" which translates to ""go back to where you came from(India)"". We're sick of that phrase. Sick. 

Listen, if you have a friend who's a minority who's complaining about their situation , shut up and listen. There's way more pain behind those words.

I feel like I don't need to mention that this doesn't apply to all Malays in my country. Pretty sure it should be obvious by now. Ive got a couple of decent Malay friends who're really cool.

2896,"Is art ""high"" cuz of it's subject? 


-Alot of ""low"" art explores these subjects.


 Is it ""high"" cuz of quality?


- a minority of ""low"" is better in quality than a minority of ""high"" art easily.


 Is it High cuz of method alone?


- Then why is it called ""high"".


 Is it a combination of quality and subject?


- Again, alot of Low art achieves that. 


Does art have to be purely ""fine""?


- This purism doesn't go along with ""fine"" if you ask me.


The idea that some subjects(like existentialism) are inherently very superior art subjects is stupid to me.
A wide variety of subjects can be both common and important.
It could also be argued that art is more about the ""how"" than it is about the ""what""


High Art is all around us in movies, games, anime, manga, books, novels, comics, plays, music and performance. The corner of the art world traditionally recognized as ""elite"" and ""high"" is distinguished by no more than an insignificant consistency of quality, subject and method along with economical, social and historical factors. And a good amount of pure Western delusion.


If you don't understand my rant about art then you're not missing on alot. Just live by kindness and we're good.


The merits of the extreme abstraction that the art industry prides itself in are:


1-A more accurate vision of physical reality.


2-a better appreciation of the universe


3-a more free philosophy


A counter:


1-That's just excess and it's mostly a useless and dumbed down version of realistic thinking acquired from experience and all forms of learning and character building.


2-that's the ancient human habbit of meditation where the subject of appreciation is the world which no artist can take credit for and which all art is created from and in.


3-thats philosophy, while indeed more extensively explored in the art industry, it is a subject which is explored in all human creativity to varying degrees.


And yes, all art (regardless of label and name) along with sensational pleasure in general is a secondary priority in my ideology as i consider redemption, mercy and connecting to the universe as more important.
That doesn't mean that I condem creativity. But if creativity is an obstacle in exercising a higher principal then creativity would definitely be limited as necessary.


I can understand if you separate ""high"" and ""pop"" like water and oil. It's the claim of superiority that am absolutely not convinced by, based on my experience.

2909,"I need to communicate with someone about this. I’m in agony. I’m getting my 2 bottom wisdom teeth removed on November 17th (close, but not close enough). They’re impacted, coming in almost completely sideways. I have another wisdom tooth on the top left actually erupting. I think that is also contributing but the top ones actually have room to come in. I asked once if those need to be removed as well but they said it could cause issues later. Which doesn’t make much sense to me. 

Right now though, I’m going through just absolute horrendous reoccurring pain that ibuprofen and Tylenol don’t seem to fix anymore. This has been going on for the past 4 days and it’s just relentless. This is the first night I haven’t been able to **actually** fall asleep. Most nights were spotty but I at least got some rest.

I’m calling my dentist as soon as they open in 3 hours to see if maybe there’s something they can do for me. There’s one molar (second to last molar on bottom left) that’s chipped and I think that guy might be a big cause of the problem. See if they can fill it or something. I don’t know how much more I can take of this. Clove oil, whole cloves, salt water rinse, cold press. I’ve done a lot of remedies and yet none seem to work much anymore. This is just so screwed.

On weekends, I usually get up late, eat breakfast, chill and play games most of the day. Today, I got up, had a coffee, vacuumed and mopped the floor, cleaned the kitchen and my room before breakfast.

After they left at ~23:30, I cleaned everything up after my family had gone to be. Now in bed myself, I am happy and satisfied. Making other people’s lives easier is a very fulfilling task, I find.

2927,"This happened about a year ago. I've always had a pretty bad eyes, since I was in kindergarten. My parents always scolded me, saying not to use phones or computers as it will cause my eyes to become worse with higher myopia. One side of me wanted to protect my eyes. But my other side just wanted to enjoy some games.

Since my parents never allowed me to use phones n stuff, I started playing them in secret, like in bed. So over the years, my eyes gone worse to -8, which is pretty bad, 0 is considered normal and -5 is considered as severe myopia.

I grew up to be smart and good at science. As I aged, I learnt biology and did more research on causes of myopia. Turns out, if you do activities like reading, writing or using screens in too close ranges, your eye muscles overwork and myopia occur. The ideal length from eye to the object is considered 30cm or about 12 inches.

Last year, during class, my friend just suddenly stated that I am too close to my notebook when I'm writing. Then I realized I really was. There were barely 2 inches(5cm) between my eyes and the notebook. This was a surprising news. Later the evening, I thought about how I actually wrote that way for pretty much my entire life, only because it was easier to write cleaner when I write that close. So in conclusion, my high myopia was caused by my writing habit.

If only my parents or my doctors explained how myopias were **really** caused when I was little, maybe I could've avoided from having bad eyes like these. I think parents should explain thoroughly how things affect their children's health and lifestyle, rather than just screaming at their children for doing something not so wrong(like playing phone games in my case.) I hope my story at least help one family out there.

In the right eye, it could copy, oh boy this is op... **ANY DOJUTSU ABILITY, INCLUDING JOUGAN, TENSEIGAN, AND THE RINNEGAN.** Continuing with the theme, you have to see the ability first.

The Susano could actually be used without having to see one. It would be pitch black, and would hold a standard Katana. However, the Susano could copy Any other Susano weapon, shield, or formation(**INCLUDING SASUKE'S INDRA SUSANO**) just by seeing it.

However there is always a downside, you can only copy a Jutsu Release once every year, and a MS ability / Susano ability once every 5 years PER USER.

2974,"Basically, you set up these triple compartment vending machines in stores and at malls that dispense capsules that include plastic statues of characters from this game's universe with a number on it, and a card declaring what type of character it is. The left side includes light magic characters, the right side includes dark magic characters, and the middle includes balanced characters. Each side is 50 cents to use.

Light magic characters have any number from 1 to 100 on them, balanced ones have a number from 101 to 200, and dark magic characters have a number from 201 to 300.

Basically, how you play is you buy a capsule from all 3 compartments of these machines, and you'll have one light, one dark, and one balanced character. Then go find someone who also has one of each type of character, and place them down in a row, facing your opponent's characters.

If your light magic character's number is higher than your opponent's one, you win there light magic character, If your balanced magic character's number is higher than your opponent's one, you win there balanced character. If your dark magic character's number is higher than your opponent's, you win there dark magic character.

The alternative way to play is to go all in, where you add the total numbers of all 3 characters and play it against your opponents, with the winner taking all of the losers characters.

2999,"The Wandering Albatross is the largest flying bird in the world, with a wingspan of almost 4 meters. It can stay up to months flying in the ocean without ever seeing land, and its big wingspan allows it to fly effortlessly, almost never beating his wings.

It flies near the surface of the water. Waves in the water push air up and the albatross rides this air to gain height, and then they just rotate to the direction they want to go. Then, they will glide in that direction as they fall back to sea level. Once they are near the water again, they direct themselves toward another wave, which pushes them back up again.

And they stay like this for months on end. Just flying to wherever they want, with no responsibilities, no regrets, just the smell of the ocean and the wind in its wings.

Every year, they reunite with one specific partner that they have for life long, in the exact same spot. There, they stay for several months having a rest from flying and creating a chick until it can fly on its own. Then they part again to their own journey in the world.

I was already aware of just how fascinating these birds are, but one day I was watching some documentary on TV and they showed a clip of a Wandering Albatross flying. Unfortunately I just can't find this clip anywhere, but it was one of the most peaceful things I have seen. There was no music nor narration, just the sound of the winds and the waves, while the Albatross effortlessly flew, without ever flexing his wings. The clip went on for maybe 3 or 4 minutes and it touched me deeply. Since then, every now and again I wish I could just open my wings and go to wherever I feel like, dropping everything I have and just coming back to it next year, in the same spot, in the way it always was.

About [732 days](http://www.twt.world/shirt) ago I started choosing my attire by a quick program I wrote. If anyone tries to visit that url on a weekend I apologize, it's only functional on weekdays. Today is friday the 13th - there's the sign for our bad omen. I usually miss friday the 13th but someone pointed it out today. Today I'm also wearing a black #4 shirt, which is the final shirt in the rotation (which spans 5 weeks only counting business days) dictated in that program for the last 2 years. I decided to needlessly connect the dots and say the end of the cycle - *the end* \- is the theme for the omen. I figure the end of a cycle could also be considered a loss depending on what that cycle is. And then the omen resolved. 

I got a notification on my phone. Woo! My amazon package was delivered! I checked outside and didn't see anything. I checked the delivery photo and noticed a concrete floor by the door while I'm on the 3rd floor of an apartment building and my outside floor is wood. My package was delivered to the wrong address, the omen of loss was fulfilled! 

But thank fuck this happened at the time of day that it did, because my cousin asked if the shadow could give a clue. I look at the door and the direction of the person's shadow. Not much time had past since the delivery and luckily there are only a handful of locations that would be able to cast a shadow in that direction from the front door, and I found the package at the 3rd location :) 

There are a lot of elements to this story. Here's the awkward ending - I had panicked and called amazon as soon as the thing went missing, so now it might appear to them I'm trying to pull a fast one.

I have maybe 60 some people linked as ""friends"" mostly from high school which is hilarious to me as I spend most of my high school years ignored outside of classes.  

Somewhere over the years, I found where you could hide posts from others.  About a year ago, I started wondering if you could hide the ad posts in your feed and if so what would happen if you hid all ads from all advertisers.  So I started doing it. Anytime I logged in, I would spend about 15 to 20 minutes scrolling down and hiding any post that had the sponsored tag on it.  Hide post, select reason why (Irrelevant or repetitive), hide all from this person.  I figured it would take a while to hide all advertisers.

Well it took about 6 months before I noticed anything.  All of a sudden it was much harder to doom scroll.  Soon every time I logged in, I would only see two posts in my feed and then have the shadowed posts indicating that it was trying to load more posts.  I'm guessing that because I hid all advertisers, it couldn't load any ads in the feed and horked it.  

Anytime my wife asked why I didn't ""like"" her posts, I could truthfully claim I couldn't see them because my account was hosed.  She didn't believe me until she tried logging into my account and saw the same thing.  It was great.  Forgot about FB for a while, until my wife asked what was up with my account.  I had to try logging in again and it had started working again.  I'm guessing that there were enough new advertisers added that now it could find an ad that it could load for me.  Back to hiding ads again.

Well as of this morning, my FB page won't even load.  I get a blank screen or that FB is taking too long to respond.  I think I've horked the account again as all the ""Is it down"" sites say FB is up and running fine.  I think I have earned another 2-3 months of not having to deal with FB.

Upon arriving, I meet his friend Nate, who immediately makes me uncomfortable with an abnormal amount of complients. I take a seat with Tim and order a beer, and after a few minutes Nate joins us at the table. Nate goes on attempting to get to know me and after hearing I work for a certain gov agency that deals with unemployment he starts ranting about how he's been having a great time ""drinking his ass off"" at home and how said agency owes him about $500. he proceeds to refer to said agency as n-words twice in the same sentence as causal as anything. I let Nate finish his rant which ended with yet another uncomfortable compliment and I responded ""I'm offended."" Nate replies ""Oh, do NOT be offended."" (he was referring to the compliment emphatically) \*at this point my blood pressure spiked so fast I can't quite remember what I said word-for-word\* I went off ""I can't believe you would use that language in front of me."" Tim is immediately confused and seems to have no idea what's happening. \*confused muttering between the men\* ""I don't have to tell you what you said, you should know better than to talk like that in public, or at all for that matter. I was really looking forward to having a beer with my friend but now I can't wait to pay and get the hell out of here."" Nate had the gall to reply ""I didn't mean to offend anyone."" I snapped back ""You didn't mean to offend anyone when you used the most offensive term I can even think of?! Using a word people don't even use when referring to it?!? You don't mean to offend anyone using a racial slur in conversation!??"" Nate muttered something about something and skulked away to the restroom. Tim, still feigning ignorance, acted like he didn't understand my reaction. I told him I'm not gonna sit here and deal with casual racism. while he said something to the effect of not taking sides... ""Look, I'm bi-racial and even if I wasn't I wouldn't be putting up with this bull shit. He is the one who should feel uncomfortable being a racist."" 

Nate stayed in the bathroom until after I left the restaurant. I took a minute to gather myself in my car before driving home.

It's a nice place to visit, and I recognise dream people and say hello to them. I even buy things and get annoyed when I wake up and can't find whatever I bought. I once went back into the dream and asked if anyone had handed my purchase in. I was asked if I kept a reciept, and I woke up again, looking for the reciept.

&amp;#x200B;

The second location is harder to describe. I can only describe it as a black cathedal. It sits at the bottom of a hill in a sort of bowl shaped, well-trimmed grass-covered valley. There are no buttresses or any cathedral-esque architecture, but my brain is telling me it's a cathedral, coloured completely black, to the point where you can't make out any detail (if there are any). It's almost monolithic. It's also rather ominous, with a distinct silence in the air and, there are never any other people in this dream. I can walk around the outside of the building, looking for an entrance, but every time I try to get inside, I wake up.","Does anyone else have dreams involving a location that only exists in dreams, yet they can visit it whenever they like?",0

I wasn't terrible at most things in gym, but God, I can't jump rope for the life of me. It was really embarrassing to have everyone call out a number like 120 and then I would nervously say something like 50. I didn't have it too bad though. I remember during a pushup test a student said zero when the teacher asked for his score. He looked like he was about to cry. The gym teacher said that it was good he was being honest and that PE was about encouraging fitness, and then she went back to telling everyone to call out their scores in front of the class.

3067,"This is gonna be a little long, but I'm incredibly happy right now, so I don't care. I moved in with my husband in May. My car broke down about a month or two after moving. I had been looking for a job and I was then unable to go to any interviews because I had no car. Getting it fixed or buying a used car was put on the back burner for a while. My husband's dad had a car for sale and my husband decided to buy it. This all happened in about October. 

After getting the car and the tags and whatever fixed on it, I began rapidly applying to everywhere I possibly could. I didn't hear anything back until this particular store called me back. This store is similar to Ross, but it's a competitor and it's not Marshall's. I've never worked in retail, before now I only worked in a grocery store. 

I had orientation yesterday and was officially hired. I had done the phone interview, the in person interview, and finally the orientation. It's part time like my last job, which is probably better considering I went from having a part time job and school, to having neither, to finally having one. Going from nothing to full time would be a huge change. 

This is a huge stress reliever for my husband and especially for me. I had saved money before moving, but obviously that isn't going to last forever, and I slowly watched the savings amount get smaller and smaller. I started getting worried that I was going to be more of a financial burden than anything, and now I'm finally able to help. I finally have something to \*do\* and I can finally buy stuff for my husband. I didn't want to not get anyone anything for Christmas this year, although my family would be understanding, I didn't want to do that.

- what is your relationship with space?
- why do you love space?
- why do you hate space?
- what do you feel when you look up to the sky?
- what do you think about when you think of space?
- what is your favorite thing to look at in the sky and why?
- what interests you about space and why?
- what are some personal anecdotes about space?
- What do you want people to know about space?

3087,"I live on the island of Molokai, Hawaii, which is divided into 3 areas when it comes to beaches: east end (aka Mana'e), central, and west end.

Central beaches are pretty much universally crap. The water is pretty much always brown and full of river runoff mud, and IMO it's too damn shallow. 100% do not recommend.

East end beaches are fine, but not ideal to my personal tastes. The water is actually clear, for the most part. If you like snorkeling or if you have small children, east end is probably your best bet because the whole area is protected by a barrier reef, which blocks a lot of the surf and currents. 

However, it does mean that you have to paddle really far out to go surfing. There's really only 1 good surfing spot over here anyway and that's rock point. Wailua is good for learning to surf, that's where everyone from east end takes their kids to learn how to surf. Also, the water itself is kinda shallow for swimming (again, great for small kids), and it has a lot of rocks that are just irritating because since it's so shallow you'll inevitably step on them.

West end on the other hand is mostly perfect. It has pretty good surf, it's deep enough to do actual swimming, and you won't constantly be stepping on rocks. However, there is one achilles heel to it, which is that it's really only safe to swim there between May and August. Outside of that timeframe, it's actually really dangerous to go swimming over there, because the winter storms up in the Pacific create big swells and high surf, and there's rip currents that'll pull you offshore. Unless you surf, and I don't, then this is a problem.

I've been wanting to go down to a beach at west end lately, because I like the beaches there a lot better than over here at east end, but I'm gonna basically be stuck here twiddling my thumbs waiting for May to come around.

3095,"Surrounding really Does influence your dreams

I just woke up from a dream where...

I won’t go into it, but it was a nightmare

After I awoke, I was also able to hear the noises from my mothers phone from the next room. It isn’t uncommon for her to watch actors act out a war, but I still can’t watch it for a few reasons, one of which being that it’s Really sad(for me anyways)

So, yeah, I’m pretty sure this was influenced by that, and I also had two other dreams around it, one where I basically relived a past event, which may or may not be real: it seemed to be some of my moments with my now-deceased grandmother. The other one, which might’ve been connected with the previous dream, I was having to go to this weird looking classroom, and It was an art room at the beginning. I had taken a pen already, and was just doodling. When the teach was walking around, I had thrown my pen back into the basket he was holding and grabbed another. I said that the other pen simply was running out of ink, and he got mad. He came back with a weird pencil, so I had to wrap something around some parts. It gets weird later and I don’t plan on elaborating too much for the other stories, as one I can’t remember or describe too clearly, and the other was just gruesome.

Now that I think of it, I hadn’t slept for almost 24 hours before that. So maybe that was part of it?
Of course, as it’s a dream(and cause I already had problem remembering anything) I’m slowly forgetting the experience, but I’ll try to answer anything to the best of my abilities.

3100,"Some time ago I was taking a trip for work, and I decided to enjoy my lunch break at a large local park. I love being outside, because I love nature. 

Now, I am used to jackdaws coming closer when I have lunch, though they always keep their social distance. Cool guys. They want my food, but they know that they also are food if they are not careful, so they stay away and politely ask.

Ravens are different. And I did not know, because I never met a raven. 

Until that day. 

I was enjoying my sandwich, and this raven came up to me. Walking. Not flying. Not hopping. Walking. That was the first warning I ignored. He knew he was superior to me in both abilities and intellect, and he was confident enough to not flaunt his superiority. 

The second warning was imminent. The caw. 

He stood there in front of me. Not keeping his six feet social distancing at all. He made sure to caw from five feet away. He made it a point that he was not scared of me. I was inferior, and I did not know it. At the time I had yet to realize that this was not just a big jackdaw, and I would soon find out that this creature was just as demonic as my cats. 

I ignored both warnings that my food was his. That was my mistake. It leaped and landed gracefully next to me on the bench. Which is cool, I like animals, and animals like me. Some like me for attention, some like me as food, and others like me to stay very far away (looking at you, Billy, you could have just asked instead of resorting to a bite in my arm).

Ravens are different. To him I was not a friend, not a foe, and not a food. I was the plate that held his food, and with one quick strike that would make a pro boxer jealous, he jabbed his beak towards my hands and flew off. I just screamed. If you ever read of some kind of soundwave that almost knocked the ISS out of orbit, you will know that my vocal cords were the culprits.

I calmed, took a few deep breaths and realized...

3110,"So, I just started this job about 5 days ago... and apparently I am fairly good and all of the managers like me a lot. 

So, a little back story is that I was working in a fast food / dining chain about a few months back. They started to give me attitude and it was a really toxic work place. The manager used to berate us and yell at us for having conversation when it wasnt busy. One time, she even yelled at the top of her lungs in an employees face about not laughing and doing work (even tho it wasnt busy and a really funny joke came around) etc. 

Every person at that place hated their job and that added to the toxicity. 

One day, I noticed there was mouldy donuts and ofc my coworkers didnt care much so they just said to drop it because the xyz will get killed in the hot oil. I said no, I would not do that. Anyhow, the procedures were incorrect and we were storing too many boxes of the item in the fridge rather than freezer. I called HR to ask to fix this problem...

Secondly, I realized that kitchen staff (i worked in kitchen) werent sanitizing their hands and washing them regularly when dealing with food. So I mentioned adding a procedure to HR to help implement it. 

Anyhow, the call went on, we talked. The next shift I was put on the managers began to mock me about “dont forget to wash your hands” and other petty remarks to spite me. 

They also started to limit my shifts. I was down to maybe 6-10 hours a week during the pandemic. I was shown no appreciation for my hard work and efforts. So I quit. 

Now, I am at my new workplace and I literally started less than a week ago and they’re calling me in for 8 hour shifts and other things... This only happens if you’re a solid and good worker. I was so surprised to have been called in for a MANAGERS shift!! They also call me, a new person, over the workers that have been there longer than I have! I’m so honoured. 

It actually genuinely makes me happy to know that they appreciate my hard work and its actually being paid off (literally).

3112,"I finally bit the bullet and ordered a Nintendo Switch, and it’s giving me this new sense of excitement that I haven’t felt in the last few years.

I grew up playing Pokémon on Gameboy Color, and bought the various new models as they came out. This was a casual hobby, but also a formative one that is now incredibly nostalgic. To this day, I love playing handheld games on my 3DS. 

I’ve held off on getting the Switch because I’ve been having so much fun replaying old Harvest Moon games in the pandemic, and it’s obviously much more affordable than going all-in on a whole new gaming system. But, of course, the desire was very much there. I found out that Nintendo is discontinuing the DS systems to focus on the Switch, AND that a couple of games are coming out this spring on the Switch that I will really need to play. Also, I just couldn’t justify the money part...

I started looking online a few weeks ago, not intending to buy but just too see how much I’d need to save. Everywhere was sold out. I started checking stores periodically and they kept on being sold out until 3 days ago! 

I impulsively ordered the Switch and a game and I am GIDDY about the prospect of a solitary pandemic winter playing new games for once. I live alone, so the idea of having something fun and safe to preoccupy me over the coming months is bringing me so much comfort, even though the Switch isn’t even here yet.

So I’m a sophomore college, and currently living with my parents. My school is 28 miles away, or about 40 minutes from my house. I was going there three times a week for classes, but now everything is remote. I had talked to my mom a couple months ago about getting my own place next summer, so I can spend my remaining two years closer to campus. My thinking has now shifted, and I want to do this a lot sooner. Like within the next two-three months. This is mostly due to the virus, I don’t feel 100% comfortable living here with them. They take precautions, but not as seriously as I do sometimes. I also am in a relationship with someone, who is higher risk, and so is his dad. I’ve been taking extra precautions to ensure that I can still see him and be safe, and it’s been going alright so far but it’s still risky. Financially, I cannot get a place on my own. I’m not working right now, but have been job searching. I do know that my parents would help me financially to some degree when I get a place (just not sure how much). I haven’t sat down with both of my parents yet, but my mom did mention I could take out a loan, and then pay it back. Basically, I feel trapped. I’m tempted to go temporarily stay with my sister in MO, also tempted to see if living with my bf and his parents is an option, or maybe I should just bite the bullet and do the loan. Or maybe risk it and stay here and save money. Any thoughts or advice is appreciated",Don’t know what path to take,0

As long as I can remember I wanted to become a journalist. I started to work as a freelancer when I was 18, but wasn't able to go to university at first because my grades weren't good enough.

After some detours I finally made it into my favourite university and got my degree. Right now I'm in my last months training to become an actual journalist - and I freaking loving it!

We create small posts, interviews, sound-posts and stories about corona and the lockdown and I love the creativity thats going on around me.

When I was 13 my iron levels dipped dangerously low and I fainted, hitting the ground face first. The impact broke the root of my front right tooth, pushing the tooth back all the way to the roof of my mouth. My front left tooth sliced through my lower lip. 

We went to the ER and got my lip stitched up. This happened on a Saturday so my regular dentist was unavailable and we had to go see an emergency dentist in a different city. That’s when we found out the root of my tooth had snapped. He couldn’t put me under because of some legal thing and could only give me x amount of numbing agent (I have a very high tolerance to the numbing stuff they use so typically they have to use extra to actually make my mouth numb but this doctor wasn’t my normal doctor so he could only give the typical legal amount). This involved him sticking a needle into the roof of my mouth, and the gums on both sides of the tooth. He then pulled the tooth. Unfortunately he then had to slice my gums open and pull out the root of said tooth and stitch the gums back together. Keep in mind I could feel every single part of it. 

Months after that I was put under to get an implant put in, they had to take it out because it got infected due to the original doctor missing part of the root. Had the implant put back in. Now occasionally, every few years, I have to have the false tooth re-cemented to the screw/implant.",My first and only surgery,0

3162,"I am not sure if I could recall properly, but this is show it went.

He then said that he will pay back the money through physical mail by knowing what my address is (which is a stupid move on my part) as soon as possible, and will give his phone number to call him back (though I asked for an email for an e-transfer, but he declined).

At first, I was not sure if I should give him money because it was common knowledge to not trust strangers, but at the same time, even if I was close to a busy street, I panicked because there is a chance this stranger might attack me. I told him to take the money ($20) and to not give me trouble, but the stranger told me to calm down and stated again that he only needed money to take a taxi, and will pay me back.

I decided to give him money and went my way home. I called him again after a month since I have not received the money, but he said he will send it. That event happened 2 years ago.

3166,"My first time meeting a deaf person was when I was 17. He came into the restaurant I worked at and I took his order, he had typed it out on his phone and let me take his phone to type back to clarify a few things. I was so distraught that I couldn't even say thank you or goodbye to him or his wife, they looked so kind. I so badly wanted to tell them that I hoped they had a great day but all I could do was wave and smile!! So I learned how to say a few things. Next time they came back I said hello, told them my name, and I was able to say ""thank you, goodbye!"" before they left. I was so happy to be able to speak to them they way they did a little bit, even though they still had to order by typing.

They only came to the restaurant once more, then I never saw them again. They seemed happy to see me, smiling big and waving to be as soon as they saw me, &amp; I know I was just so excited to be able to talk to them in a way that didn't (fully) require texting. After that I forgot most of my sign until I got to college and a friend was taking ASL classes as she was going to be a teacher &amp; wanted to be able to speak to any student she had, she also was working on Spanish and another language if I remember correctly. She'll be an amazing teacher. So I started learning again, from her, and thank God I did because a close family member of mine recently woke up completely deaf, let's call him K. He'd been becoming hard of hearing slowly, but suddenly it was just.... gone. He and his wife have been using text messaging to talk to eachother now. 

I've always read about how isolating it can be when deaf &amp; surrounded by hearing people. Language barriers of all kinds can make things so lonely.. Plus, K is in his late sixties and, y'know, old dogs don't always want to learn new tricks. He's can be hard to handle sometimes as he can be rather abrasive, but he's family to me &amp; there's nothing I wouldn't do for him &amp; his wife, even if his is a grouch sometimes. I don't know if he'll try to learn it or not, to be honest.

So I sent his wife every resource I had on ASL, every tip I could think of (like printing out hand signs for common objects and taping them to the object) and while they try to figure out whats going on with the doctors, I started writing letters since we can't talk on the phone anymore. It breaks my heart knowing he's struggling, especially because I know his children are the type who will sit around him and talk to eachother but not bother to learn ASL to speak to K. They probably wouldn't even text with him, I mean they didnt ever text him before &amp; I don't see that changing. Imove back home in 9 months and I will do my best to make sure he's never left out, to make sure his only conversation for the rest of his life aren't just through texting.

I just... my heart hurts so much. If ASL was more widely taught or offered maybe people like him wouldn't struggle so much. Maybe hard of hearing &amp; deaf people wouldn't so often feel left out by their own families. Maybe hard of hearing &amp; deaf people wouldn't always have to use their phones to type out an order and hand it over to the person behind the counter. The real disability of losing hearing or being born without it, is the inability to communicate with most of their communities... There is so much more we could do for the deaf communities within our own communities, no one deserves to be left out of conversation like that.

Anyways, I know I typed a lot out here. If you've read this far, thank you. I think ASL is beautiful &amp; I pray the world can be better for our hard of hearing and deaf population. This has been hard for me, I can't imagine how K is feeling... I hope he answers my letters soon, but I know he's having a hard time. Again, thank you for reading.
